Founder of Epic Privacy Browser Alok Bhardwaj has argued that NetNeutrality preservation through legislation is consistent with implementing quality of service protocols.,NET_NEUTRAL,1,0,0,0
He argues legislation should ban the charging of fees for any quality of service which would both allow networks to implement quality of service as well as remove any incentive to abuse NetNeutrality ideas.,NET_NEUTRAL,1,0,0,0
