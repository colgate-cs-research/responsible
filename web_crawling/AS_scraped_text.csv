WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trade groups representing major technology companies and advocacy groups on Friday asked a U.S. appeals court to reconsider its October ruling that largely upheld the 2017 repeal of landmark NetNeutrality rules.,"Amazon.com, Inc."
The FCC in December 2017 reversed Obama-era rules prohibiting internet service providers (ISPs) from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes a blow to large tech companies and consumer groups that had championed NetNeutrality.,"Amazon.com, Inc."
“The decision presents an issue of exceptional importance as it affirms the reversal of U.S. policies promoting the OpenInternet and the repeal of the FCC’s 2015 NetNeutrality rules” said one of the petitions.,"Amazon.com, Inc."
As a consequence ISPs are permitted to block or throttle Internet access demand pay-to-play ransom from Internet edge providers or otherwise interfere with end users’ access to the Internet” the petition said.,"Amazon.com, Inc."
The appeals court in its October decision also ruled the FCC erred when it declared that states cannot pass their own NetNeutrality laws and ordered the agency to review some key aspects of its 2017 repeal of rules set by the Obama administration including public safety implications and how its decision will impact a government subsidy program for low-income users.,"Amazon.com, Inc."

As the Obama administration begins to enact tech policy two of its biggest challenges will be deciding how to deploy national broadband services and whether to impose strict NetNeutrality rules on American carriers.,"NTT America, Inc."
If the administration decides to look abroad for answers it will see that see that countries such as Japan South Korea and France have developed faster and less expensive broadband networks but have also refrained thus far from implementing strict NetNeutrality rules.,"NTT America, Inc."
Harold Feld the senior vice president for the open media advocacy group Media Access Project says that the FCC's decision to revoke common carrier requirements sparked fears that ISPs could start blocking their competitors' content and services in order to give priority to their own.,"NTT America, Inc."
This led many consumer advocacy groups and Internet companies to promote strict enforcement of NetNeutrality rules the principle that ISPs should not be allowed to block or degrade Internet traffic from their competitors in order to speed up their own.,"NTT America, Inc."
The major telcos meanwhile have uniformly opposed NetNeutrality by arguing that such government intervention would take away ISPs' incentives to upgrade their networks thus stalling the widespread deployment of broadband Internet.,"NTT America, Inc."

"Like Feld Lessig thinks that NetNeutrality is a ""thin and light substitute"" for policies that promote more competition and invest government money directly into building out broadband infrastructure.","NTT America, Inc."
Indeed Feld says that another major reason why enforcing NetNeutrality is less of a priority in other countries is that governments have helped their carriers pay for building fiber networks.,"NTT America, Inc."
After all he says ISPs in Japan and South Korea are less likely to feel the need to throttle traffic when their pipes can deliver data at rates that dwarf speeds in the United States.,"NTT America, Inc."

In the absence of these rules Weisman and Feld think that enforcing NetNeutrality is the next-best option for promoting effective competition.,"NTT America, Inc."
Weisman says that enforcing NetNeutrality in other countries is less of an issue because governments have already set expectations for how they expect ISPs to behave and regulators merely watch for anticompetitive behavior rather than inspect the Web for traffic throttling.,"NTT America, Inc."

"Google Chairman Eric Schmidt aligns Google's views on data discrimination with Verizon's: ""I want to be clear what we mean by NetNeutrality: What we mean is if you have one data type like video you don't discriminate against one person's video in favor of another.","NTT America, Inc."
NetNeutrality supporters had also made several comments on the FCC website opposing plans to remove NetNeutrality especially after a segment by John Oliver regarding this topic was aired on his show Last Week Tonight.,"NTT America, Inc."
However in response Ajit Pai selected one particular comment that specifically supported removal of NetNeutrality policies.,"NTT America, Inc."
The vote passed and a resolution was approved to try and remove the FCC's new rules on NetNeutrality; however officials doubt there is enough time to completely repeal the rules before the OpenInternet Order officially expired on June 11 2018.,"NTT America, Inc."
In March 2019 congressional supporters of NetNeutrality introduced the Save the Internet Act in both the House and Senate which if passed would reverse the FCC's 2017 repeal of NetNeutrality protections.,"NTT America, Inc."
In the U.S government city tech leaders warned in 2017 that the FCC’s repeal of NetNeutrality will widen the digital divide negatively affect small businesses and job opportunities for middle class and low-income citizens.,"NTT America, Inc."
In the United States NetNeutrality the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) treat all data on the Internet the same and not discriminate has been an issue of contention between network users and access providers since the 1990s.,"NTT America, Inc."
"To elucidate the term ""NetNeutrality"" one can apply a metaphor that was given and illustrated by Michael Goodwin: In his illustration he illustrates ISPs as the driveway that connects a home to the vast network of destinations on the internet and NetNeutrality is the principle that prevents ISPs from slowing some traffic or charging a premium fee for other traffic.","NTT America, Inc."
"A core issue to NetNeutrality is how ISPs should be classified under the Communications Act of 1934 if they should be Title I ""information services"" or TitleII ""common carrier services"".","NTT America, Inc."
The makeup of the 5-member FCC has changed with each new administration leading to the state of NetNeutrality flipping back and forth over the last two decades.,"NTT America, Inc."
"In 2005 the FCC adopted NetNeutrality principles ""to preserve and promote the vibrant and open character of the Internet as the telecommunications marketplace enters the broadband age.""","NTT America, Inc."
Between 2005 and 2012 five attempts to pass bills in Congress containing NetNeutrality provisions failed.,"NTT America, Inc."
In response to legal challenges from ISPs challenging the FCC's ability to set NetNeutrality principles the FCC in 2015 issued the OpenInternet Order which reclassified ISPs as TitleII services and giving them authority to enforce NetNeutrality.,"NTT America, Inc."
Upon becoming FCC chairman in April 2017 as part of the Trump Administration Ajit Pai proposed to repeal the neutrality policies returning to the previous classification of ISPs as Title I services.,"NTT America, Inc."
Several states and Internet service providers challenged this ruling and while the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in early October 2019 that the FCC has the ability to reclassify ISPs as Title I or II and allowing the rule change to stand the Court also ruled that the FCC cannot block state or local-level NetNeutrality enforcement.,"NTT America, Inc."

"On April 13 2015 the FCC published the final rule on its new ""NetNeutrality"" regulations.","NTT America, Inc."
The United States Telecom Association which represents large telecom companies filed a lawsuit against the FCC in 2015 challenging the NetNeutrality rule.,"NTT America, Inc."
In June 2016 a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the FCC's NetNeutrality rules and the FCC's determination that broadband access is a public utility rather than a luxury.,"NTT America, Inc."
On June 11 2018 the repeal of the FCC's rules took effect ending NetNeutrality regulation in the United States.,"NTT America, Inc."
The ideas underlying NetNeutrality have a long pedigree in telecommunications practice and regulation.,"NTT America, Inc."
The legal debate about NetNeutrality regulations of the 2000s echoes this debate.,"NTT America, Inc."
In the early 2000s legal scholars such as Tim Wu and Lawrence Lessig raised the issue of neutrality in a series of academic papers addressing regulatory frameworks for packet networks.,"NTT America, Inc."
In early 2005 in the Madison River case the FCC for the first time showed the willingness to enforce its NetNeutrality principles by opening an investigation about Madison River Communications a local telephone carrier that was blocking voice over IP service.,"NTT America, Inc."
This made up a voluntary set of four NetNeutrality principles.,"NTT America, Inc."
"In December 2006 the AT&T/Bell South merger agreement defined NetNeutrality as an agreement on the part of the broadband provider: ""not to provide or to sell to Internet content application or service providers ... any service that privileges degrades or prioritizes any (data) packet transmitted over AT&T/BellSouth's wireline broadband Internet access service based on its source ownership or destination.","NTT America, Inc."
In 2007 Comcast the largest cable company in the US was found to be blocking or severely delaying BitTorrent uploads on their network using a technique which involved creating 'reset' packets (TCP RST) that appeared to come from the other party.,"NTT America, Inc."
An August 2007 report by TorrentFreak (based on substantial nationwide research led by chief researcher Andrew Norton) noted that ISPs had been throttling BitTorrent traffic for almost two years since 2005 but Comcast was completely blocking it in at least some cases.,"NTT America, Inc."
"On March 27 2008 Comcast and BitTorrent reached an agreement to work together on network traffic where Comcast was to adopt a protocol-neutral stance ""as soon as the end of "" and explore ways to ""more effectively manage traffic on its network at peak times.","NTT America, Inc."
It voted 3-to-2 to uphold a complaint against Comcast ruling that it had illegally inhibited users of its high-speed Internet service from using file-sharing software because it throttled the bandwidth available to certain customers for video files to ensure that other customers had adequate bandwidth.,"NTT America, Inc."
The FCC imposed no fine but required Comcast to end such blocking in the year 2008 ordered Comcast to disclose the details of its network management practices within 30 days submit a compliance plan for ending the offending practices by the end of the year and disclose to the public the details of intended future practices.,"NTT America, Inc."
"In an interview Martin stated that ""We are preserving the open character of the Internet"" and ""We are saying that network operators can't block people from getting access to any content and any applications.","NTT America, Inc."
Towards the end of 2009 FCC Chair Julius Genachowski announced at the Brookings Institution a series of proposals that would prevent telecommunications cable and wireless companies from blocking certain information on the Internet for example Skype applications.,"NTT America, Inc."
He argued that wireless should be subject to the same NetNeutrality as wireline providers.,"NTT America, Inc."
In October 2009 the FCC gave notice of proposed rule making on NetNeutrality.,"NTT America, Inc."
In May 2010 the FCC announced it would continue its fight for NetNeutrality.,"NTT America, Inc."
In 2008 when the FCC auctioned off the 700 MHz block of wireless spectrum in anticipation of the DTV transition Google promised to enter a bid of $4.6 billion if the FCC required the winning licensee to adhere to four conditions:,"NTT America, Inc."
The FCC adopted only two of these four criteria for the auction viz. open devices and open applications and only applied these conditions to the nationwide C block portion of the band.,"NTT America, Inc."
"On December 21 2010 the FCC voted on and passed a set of six net ""neutrality principles"":","NTT America, Inc."
The NetNeutrality rule did not keep ISPs from charging more for faster access.,"NTT America, Inc."
The measure was denounced by NetNeutrality advocates as a capitulation to telecommunication companies such as allowing them to discriminate on transmission speed for their profit especially on mobile devices like the iPad while pro-business advocates complained about any regulation of the Internet at all.,"NTT America, Inc."
Advocates of NetNeutrality criticized the changes.,"NTT America, Inc."
"On January 14 2014 the DC Circuit Court determined in the case of Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC that the FCC had no authority to enforce NetNeutrality rules as long as service providers were not identified as ""common carriers"".","NTT America, Inc."
As a response to the DC Circuit Court's decision a dispute developed as to whether NetNeutrality could be guaranteed under existing law or if reclassification of ISPs was needed to ensure NetNeutrality.,"NTT America, Inc."
Advocates of NetNeutrality have generally supported reclassifying ISPs under TitleII while FCC leadership and ISPs have generally opposed such reclassification.,"NTT America, Inc."
On February 19 2014 the FCC announced plans to formulate new rules to resume enforcing NetNeutrality while complying with the court rulings.,"NTT America, Inc."
However in the event on April 23 2014 the FCC reported a new draft rule that would permit broadband ISPs such as Comcast and Verizon to offer content providers such as Netflix Disney or Google willing to pay a higher price faster connection speeds so their customers would have preferential access thus reversing its earlier position and (so far as opinion outside the ISP sector generally agreed) would deny NetNeutrality.,"NTT America, Inc."
Shortly afterwards during late April 2014 the contours of a document leaked that indicated that the FCC under Wheeler would consider promulgating rules allowing Internet service providers (ISPs) to violate NetNeutrality principles by making it easier for Internet users to access certain content — whose owners paid fees to the ISPs (including cable companies and wireless ISPs) — and harder to access other content thus undermining the traditional open architecture of the Internet.,"NTT America, Inc."
On May 15 2014 in the face of continuing intense focus and criticism the FCC stated it would consider two options regarding Internet services: first permit fast and slow broadband lanes thereby compromising NetNeutrality; and second reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service thereby preserving NetNeutrality.,"NTT America, Inc."
""" On November 10 2014 President Obama stepped in and recommended the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve NetNeutrality.","NTT America, Inc."
NetNeutrality is the Fairness Doctrine.,"NTT America, Inc."
On January 16 2015 Republicans presented legislation in the form of a U. S. Congress HR discussion draft bill that made concessions to NetNeutrality but prohibited the FCC from accomplishing that goal or from enacting any further regulation affecting ISPs.,"NTT America, Inc."
Adoption of this notion would reclassify Internet service from one of information to one of telecommunications and ensure NetNeutrality according to FCC chairman Tom Wheeler.,"NTT America, Inc."
Social media platforms had a large role on engaging the public in the debate surrounding NetNeutrality.,"NTT America, Inc."
On January 26 2015 popular blogging site Tumblr placed links to group Fight For The Future a NetNeutrality advocacy group.,"NTT America, Inc."
NetNeutrality advocacy groups such as Save the Internet coalition and Battle for the Net responded to the 2015 FCC ruling by calling for defense of the new NetNeutrality rules.,"NTT America, Inc."
On March 12 2015 the FCC released the specific details of its new NetNeutrality rules and on April 13 2015 the final rule was published.,"NTT America, Inc."
"After his appointment Pai stated that he planned to ""modernize"" FCC policies to ""match the reality of the modern marketplace"" but was unsure over whether the FCC would continue to enforce the NetNeutrality rules or TitleII classification of broadband services.","NTT America, Inc."
"In an interview on May 5 2017 with NPR Pai stated his argument against NetNeutrality enforcement rules to be only about focusing on fixing actual anti-competitive behavior that Internet providers show as opposed to just ""regulating against hypothetical harms"".","NTT America, Inc."
"He believes that strict NetNeutrality rules would ""prohibit a number of pro-competitive business arrangements"" and ""would reduce investments"".","NTT America, Inc."
"In April 2017 it was reported that Pai had proposed that the NetNeutrality rules and TitleII classifications be rolled back that ISPs should instead ""voluntarily"" commit to the principles and that violations of them should be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission instead of the FCC as unfair or deceptive business practices.","NTT America, Inc."
On April 29 2017 a clearer understanding of the latest NetNeutrality compromise proposal was described.,"NTT America, Inc."
"On May 18 2017 the FCC voted to move forward with Pai's Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on ""Restoring Internet freedom"" by rolling back NetNeutrality regulations.","NTT America, Inc."
The primary argument in this NPRM is that the TitleII Order (on NetNeutrality) has pushed the major telecoms to reduce their capital expenditures (CapEx) in new infrastructure thereby threatening the future of the nation.,"NTT America, Inc."
However the accompanying plot of the USTelecom data cited (but not plotted) in the NPRM raises questions about whether the TitleII Order generated a major reduction in Telecom Capex following the FCC's 2015 TitleII Order on NetNeutrality:  Roughly three quarters of the annual changes between 1996 and 2015 were larger.,"NTT America, Inc."
"To investigate the suggestion that some of the anti-NetNeutrality comments might be fraudulently using the names of real people without their knowledge Fight for the Future created a web site called comcastroturf claiming  ""Someone has submitted nearly half a million anti-NetNeutrality comments to the FCC many of which appear to be completely fake — using stolen names and addresses"" and inviting the reader to see if comments had been filed by someone else in his / her name.","NTT America, Inc."
“This is exactly why we need TitleII NetNeutrality protections that ban blocking throttling and censorship” said Evan Greer campaign director of Fight for the Future “If Ajit Pai’s plan is enacted there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply blocking sites like Comcastroturf.com that are critical of their corporate policies”.,"NTT America, Inc."
"On June 15 2017 Gigi Sohn who had previously served as a top counselor to then-FCC chairman Tom Wheeler published ""4 steps to writing an impactful NetNeutrality comment (which you should do)"":","NTT America, Inc."
On November 21 2017 FCC chairman Pai unveiled plans to repeal the NetNeutrality policy in the United States.,"NTT America, Inc."
As these comments were made available to the public third-party groups began analyzing their contents recognizing many comments that were against NetNeutrality shared the same language and were considered to be duplicative.,"NTT America, Inc."
At least twenty-four people listed by the FCC as giving anti-NetNeutrality comments signed an open letter to the FCC in May 2017 requesting the comments they were asserted to have made to be removed from public record.,"NTT America, Inc."
Shortly after this study New York State's Attorney General Barbara Underwood one of the critics of the FCC's process issued a subpoena to over a dozen advocacy groups on both sides of the NetNeutrality debate to determine if they had a role in the massive number of fraudulent comments left at the FCC's system.,"NTT America, Inc."
The FCC denied the requests in December 2018 citing that releasing this information would leave the US vulnerable to a cyberattack and Pai wrote in an attached statement that at least 500000 of the comments were tied to Russian addresses interfering in the process and trying to swing the public opinion in favor of keeping the Obama-era NetNeutrality rules.,"NTT America, Inc."
Separately Gizmodo found the language of the duplicated comments shares many similarities with statements made by the Center for Individual Freedom (CFIF) which had been outspoken against NetNeutrality of the page.,"NTT America, Inc."
"Within minutes after the FCC vote on December 14 2017 New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced his intent to lead a multi-state lawsuit against the FCC to ""stop illegal rollback of NetNeutrality"".","NTT America, Inc."

"However the opinion stated that the FCC had ""disregard of its duty"" in evaluating the impact of NetNeutrality on public safety using the example of throttled communications that impacted the capabilities of first responders during the 2018 Camp Fire.","NTT America, Inc."
The Court did rule against the FCC vacating the rule's limitations against state-level actions to enforce NetNeutrality as Congress had not given the FCC any such authority via the Telecommunications Act.,"NTT America, Inc."
In January 2018 fifty United States senators had endorsed legislative action under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to reverse the repeal of TitleII NetNeutrality.,"NTT America, Inc."
The motion to restore NetNeutrality passed in the Senate on May 16 2018.,"NTT America, Inc."
While the revised FCC order repealing NetNeutrality has become official as of June 11 2018 it had possible for the House to take action to reverse the decision but even with CRA passage the action would have to be signed into law by the President.,"NTT America, Inc."
While various states have enacted versions of NetNeutrality laws these mostly have been working within the established parameters set by the FCC.,"NTT America, Inc."
Legal experts believe this clause to be flawed and would allow states to still override the FCC's decision on NetNeutrality as the language divests the FCC from regulating broadband carriers and thus would disallow them from preventing states from regulating them.,"NTT America, Inc."
California had been working since 2015 to implement a stronger form of NetNeutrality than the previous 2015 FCC decision including provisions that the FCC had not included in the 2015 language.,"NTT America, Inc."
Following the FCC's revoking of the prior NetNeutrality language California's legislature has been working to push this into law and by September 2018 Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 822 which is scheduled to go into effect on January 1 2019.,"NTT America, Inc."
Comcast blocked ports of VPNs forcing the state of Washington for example to contract with telecommunications providers to ensure that its employees had access to unimpeded broadband for telecommuting applications.,"NTT America, Inc."
In 2005 North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage.,"NTT America, Inc."

In September 2012 a group of public interest organizations such as Free Press Public Knowledge and the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute filed a complaint with the FCC that AT&T was violating NetNeutrality rules by restricting use of Apple's video-conferencing application FaceTime on cellular networks to those who have a shared data plan on AT&T excluding those with older unlimited or tiered data plans.,"NTT America, Inc."
While both fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose their management practices mobile broadband providers have greater latitude for blocking devices and applications (as long as they do not compete with the provider's own voice or video telephony services) and discriminating in how they serve traffic in accordance with reasonable network-management practices.,"NTT America, Inc."
Arguments associated with NetNeutrality regulations came into prominence in mid-2002 with nine different bills introduced on this issue between 2006 and 2013.,"NTT America, Inc."
There has been extensive debate about whether NetNeutrality should be required by law in the United States.,"NTT America, Inc."
Advocates of NetNeutrality have raised concerns about the ability of broadband providers to use their last mile infrastructure to block Internet applications and content (e.g.,"NTT America, Inc."
websites services and protocols) and even to block out competitors.,"NTT America, Inc."
While opponents claim NetNeutrality regulations would deter investment into improving broadband infrastructure and try to fix something that isn't broken.,"NTT America, Inc."
In 2014 Professor Susan Crawford a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School suggested that municipal broadband might be a possible solution to NetNeutrality concerns.,"NTT America, Inc."

Outside of the US several countries have removed NetNeutrality protocols and have started double charging for delivering content (once to consumer and again to content providers).,"NTT America, Inc."
Many have pointed out that sites such as Facebook Google and Amazon would not have been able to survive if NetNeutrality hadn't been in place.,"NTT America, Inc."
NetNeutrality proponents argue that telecom companies seek to impose a tiered service model in order to control the pipeline and thereby remove competition create artificial scarcity and oblige subscribers to buy their otherwise noncompetitive services.,"NTT America, Inc."
Many believe NetNeutrality to be primarily important for the preservation of current internet freedoms; a lack of NetNeutrality would allow Internet service providers such as Comcast to extract payment from content providers like Netflix and these charges would ultimately be passed on to consumers.,"NTT America, Inc."
Civil rights organizations such as the Color of Change the National Hispanic Media Coalition and more argue that NetNeutrality is also important for communities of color because it allows for them to tell their own stories and “organize for racial and social justice.,"NTT America, Inc."
By doing so their voices can be heard because beforehand ISPs could “block unpopular speech and prevent dissident voices from speaking freely online.,"NTT America, Inc."

To handle the backlash from last year’s NetNeutrality repeal major internet companies turned to a bold and novel strategy: Lying to customers and pretending that no actually they really care lots about NetNeutrality.,Sprint
What Claure certainly seems to be saying is that PaidPrioritization — offering faster data to companies willing to pay for it — is an acceptable revenue-generating tactic for networks.,Sprint
If that’s the case Claure is going directly against well-agreed principles of NetNeutrality which hold that data should be treated equally and fast lanes and slow lanes shouldn’t exist.,Sprint
If he was simply implying that the rollout of 5G is going to enable Sprint to charge a higher price for wireless data then that’s simply bad business not a violation of NetNeutrality.,Sprint
Of course Claure wrapped things up with the obligatory lip service to how Sprint just like everyone else loves NetNeutrality.,Sprint
“We’re big believers in the OpenInternet” Claure said.,Sprint
Claure was responding to a question from moderator Kristie Lu Stout of CNN who asked whether the operator would adhere to OpenInternet and NetNeutrality principles.,Sprint
Claure’s statements contrasted sharply with those from Andrus Ansip vice president of the European Commission who argued for a forceful application of NetNeutrality guidelines across Europe and beyond.,Sprint
“Internet providers must treat all internet traffic equally” he said noting specifically that operators should be prohibited from blocking or throttling specific types of content on the internet.,Sprint
“I believe everyone has the right to access an OpenInternet where all traffic should be treated equally … I will continue to protect an OpenInternet and NetNeutrality.”,Sprint
Pai of course led the U.S. regulator’s repeal of Obama-era NetNeutrality guidelines.,Sprint
Pai argued that the FCC made the right move in rescinding NetNeutrality guidelines because he said those rules would inhibit innovation.,Sprint
"""The bottom line is simple: We had a free and OpenInternet for two decades before 2015 and we will have a free and OpenInternet going forward.”",Sprint

"Update 4/27/2012 - AT&T shareholders voted overwhelmingly to reject the ""wireless NetNeutrality"" proposal yesterday.",Sprint
Frustrated by failed or botched efforts to impose “NetNeutrality” rules in Congress at the FCC and in the courts self-styled consumer advocates are now turning their attention to regulation by corporate governance.,Sprint
Following an SEC ruling in February proxies for AT&T Verizon and Sprint must now carry an awkwardly-worded shareholder proposal that if passed would require each carrier to “operate its wireless broadband network consistent with NetNeutrality principles.”,Sprint
This is of course a terrible idea and no one can seriously expect it to generate more than a little publicity (mission accomplished) and the opportunity to recycle the over-the-top rhetoric of those who believe that the lack of enforceable NetNeutrality principles threatens the very existence of the Internet on a daily basis.,Sprint
NetNeutrality for those new to this particular soap opera is an idea proposed not by Internet designers or engineers but by law professors.,Sprint
No two people agree on how providers of consumer broadband connections would have to change their existing or constrain future network management practices to comply with the “principles” of NetNeutrality.,Sprint
Indeed throughout 2010 as the FCC devoted nearly all of its resources to trying to solve the non-existent crisis through a rulemaking those arguing most loudly for a pure NetNeutrality regime never once proposed language that they would find acceptable.,Sprint
The final rules adopted by the agency were sniffed at as “fake” NetNeutrality “not neutrality” and similar smugness.,Sprint
And didn’t the Rebel Alliance—I mean the NetNeutrality advocates--win?,Sprint
Didn’t the FCC after threatening to redefine broadband Internet as a telephone service when it became clear Congress wasn’t going to give authority over broadband Internet and losing in court on its early attempts to enforce NetNeutrality—didn’t the FCC enact NetNeutrality regulations at the end of 2010 anyway?,Sprint
First to be technical the FCC has never used the meaningless and perfectly elastic phrase “NetNeutrality” preferring instead the equally unhelpful but less abused phrase “OpenInternet.”  Second the rules that were passed in 2010 didn’t satisfy the most vociferous neutrality supporters who in fact condemned them Chairman Genachowski and most of their corporate allies before the ink had even dried.,Sprint
The hope is that shareholders will be lulled into believing that something that sounds as nice as “NetNeutrality” can’t be bad for their interests.,Sprint
If the proposals pass they will force the largest mobile broadband Internet providers to lash themselves to the mast of “NetNeutrality principles” before sailing past the siren call of network management techniques and specialized services that might otherwise dash them—and the Internet—against the rocks of a non-neutral network.,Sprint
"These proposals in some sense are even worse than the all the previous efforts to force network operators to pre-commit to ""NetNeutrality principles.""",Sprint
Most disturbing the sponsors of these proposals scrupulously ignore the difficult problem of defining what “NetNeutrality principles” actually are—let alone what it would mean to operate mobile broadband services in a manner “consistent” with them—by offering no definition whatsoever.,Sprint
NetNeutrality advocates see violations everywhere.,Sprint
Julian Sanchez of the Cato Institute has kept a kind of running diary of all the surprising things that the most vocal NetNeutrality supporters have claimed to be violations of both the “principles” and the actual rules.,Sprint
During a 2010 dispute between Fox and Cablevision over retransmission rights (the bane of the current regulated cable industry) Fox blocked Cablevision Internet customers from accessing programming on Fox websites.,Sprint
Profligate NetNeutrality advocates at Public Knowledge condemned that tactic as “one of the grossest violations of the OpenInternet committed by a U.S. company.”  This despite the fact that Fox isn’t a provider of Internet access but a content provider—the kind of company who is supposed to be protected by not subject to NetNeutrality rules.,Sprint
All of these it seems are violations of “NetNeutrality principles.”  (The organization’s own “position” on NetNeutrality at the time sensibly limited application of the principles to “network operators.”  That was apparently a detail so minor it didn't require explanation.),Sprint
Just this month Comcast found itself accused of violating NetNeutrality principles with a new service that lets current cable TV and Internet customers use an Xbox as an alternative to a set-top box for accessing and viewing Xfinity on-demand programming.,Sprint
But because some of that programming (movies and TV shows) is also offered by Internet-based services including Netflix Hulu and YouTube the NetNeutrality lobby cried foul.,Sprint
Again a violation of NetNeutrality principles or worse.,Sprint
The Apple complaint charges that by curating apps for the iPhone Apple is denying consumers the right to “download and utilize applications of their choosing” a violation of the neutrality principle.,Sprint
NetNeutrality again.,Sprint
Both complaints unfortunately for their promoters need to find their way around a few disagreeable provisions in the FCC’s rules that explicitly exempt mobile broadband from the discrimination rule and which explicitly exempt app stores from the blocking rule.,Sprint
The blocking rule by the way bans blocking only of competing voice or video applications.,Sprint
(“The prohibition on blocking applications that compete with a broadband provider’s voice or video telephony services does not apply to a broadband provider’s operation of application stores or their functional equivalent.”)  No matter.,Sprint
If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it’s a NetNeutrality violation.,Sprint
And to neutrality true believers everything is a duck.,Sprint
The closest the sphinxlike shareholder proposals come to saying what they actually mean by operating a mobile broadband network “consistent with NetNeutrality principles” comes in an “i.e.” at the very end of the resolution: “i.e. operate a neutral network with neutral routing along the company’s wireless infrastructure such that the company does not privilege degrade or prioritize any packet transmitted over its wireless infrastructure based on its source ownership or destination.”,Sprint
It doesn’t help that this explanation lurches in the general direction of a definition for “neutral” by using the word “neutral” two more times.,Sprint
Oh yes the sanctified NetNeutrality principle.,Sprint
As I said at the outset the neutrality principal began life not with engineers but as the idealized romance of legal academics and their fellow travelers.,Sprint
The Internet was never “open” or “neutral” at least not the way the romantics believe it was or should be.,Sprint
As I wrote recently in the journal CommLaw Conspectus even the pro-neutrality majority of FCC Commissioners who voted for the 2010 rules cataloged over a dozen essential exceptions to the neutrality principle that have long been part of the Internet’s core architecture.,Sprint
These exceptions exemptions and limits—along with the more limited restrictions for mobile broadband operators generally--are excused from the FCC’s rules despite to use the FCC’s word an appearance of being “inconsistent” with the neutrality principle.,Sprint
The Commissioners now understand that without these and other network management techniques there would be no Internet--open neutral or otherwise.,Sprint
Indeed they really would have been the end of the Internet as we know it to borrow a favorite phrase of the neutrality romantics.,Sprint
Each of the exceptions “degrades privileges or prioritizes” some packets over others.,Sprint

However in the event on April 23 2014 the FCC reported a new draft rule that would permit broadband ISPs such as Comcast and Verizon to offer content providers such as Netflix Disney or Google willing to pay a higher price faster connection speeds so their customers would have preferential access thus reversing its earlier position and (so far as opinion outside the ISP sector generally agreed) would deny NetNeutrality.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Adoption of this notion would reclassify Internet service from one of information to one of telecommunications and ensure NetNeutrality according to FCC chairman Tom Wheeler.,HighSpeed Office Limited

On December 14 the FCC is due to vote on a plan to repeal its NetNeutrality regime.,HighSpeed Office Limited
The FCC’s NetNeutrality rules prevent Internet service providers such as Comcast and Verizon from blocking or slowing down (legal) content.,HighSpeed Office Limited
They also prohibit them from engaging in “PaidPrioritization” or letting some companies pay to have their content delivered faster than others.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Advocates of NetNeutrality argue that the agency’s rules are more important than ever now that ISPs are getting deeper into content themselves—a shift that could tempt them to give their own services an unfair advantage over rival ones.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Under NetNeutrality the FCC can scrutinize these so-called “zero rating” deals on a case-by-case basis.,HighSpeed Office Limited

Today more than 40 major tech companies from Google to Amazon to Netflix are throwing up banners in support of NetNeutrality Day of Action attempting to stop the FCC’s attempt to roll back regulations protecting a free and OpenInternet.,HighSpeed Office Limited
We talked via email with New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman whose office is in the midst of a legal case against Spectrum–Time Warner Cable over their poor broadband service about NetNeutrality what his office has seen while investigating ISPs and what the rollback of regulations would mean for the average New Yorker.,HighSpeed Office Limited
How does the concept of NetNeutrality — having regulations mandating free and OpenInternet — affect the average consumer?﻿We’ve all had the frustration of using a service like Spotify or Hulu and waiting for it to load.,HighSpeed Office Limited
That’s a warning sign of what things would be like if the federal government undoes net-neutrality protections — allowing the broadband industry to put profits ahead of the needs of their own consumers and charge companies and other content providers for access to an internet “fast lane.” The voices of the digital haves who can afford to pay for preferential treatment would drown out the digital have-nots.,HighSpeed Office Limited
We just have to look at how these companies have abused their power in the past to understand the risks New Yorkers would face if NetNeutrality is rolled back.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Did you see any change in ISP behavior after the FCC passed its net-neutrality ruling in 2015?,HighSpeed Office Limited

NetNeutrality rules released in 2015 placed heavy restrictions on internet providers preventing them from price controlling or slowing down the access to certain websites.,HighSpeed Office Limited
CDT is committed to protecting the OpenInternet.,HighSpeed Office Limited
This post is part of a series that explores the implications of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to roll back NetNeutrality protections.,HighSpeed Office Limited
This model of the internet relies on fundamental principles of NetNeutrality enforced through government protections and the forces of a competitive marketplace.,HighSpeed Office Limited
And in the absence of a competitive market for high speed broadband the FCC instituted NetNeutrality protections through the 2015 OpenInternet Order (OIO).,HighSpeed Office Limited
More specifically Chairman Pai has suggested that bright-line protections to prevent blocking throttling and PaidPrioritization are unnecessary.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Broadly speaking NetNeutrality rules are the protections that internet users have in their relationship with ISPs.,HighSpeed Office Limited
The case for restrictions against blocking and throttling is relatively straightforward.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Ultimately the result of a repeal of NetNeutrality protections would be a more limited and expensive experience for internet users and a more arduous and costly development process for internet-based companies.,HighSpeed Office Limited
To help bolster the case ISPs stressed that they “do not block slow down or discriminate against lawful content” and that reclassification of broadband service under TitleII is inappropriate.,HighSpeed Office Limited
First while ISPs have tried to draw a distinction between TitleII and NetNeutrality they are essentially arguing that they support NetNeutrality but not the legal basis necessary to implement it.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Without a TitleII foundation the FCC will not be able to implement strong NetNeutrality protections likely leaving consumers with limited recourse for enforcement and relief when ISPs violate the rules.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Second contrary to the argument made by Chairman Pai there are numerous examples of ISPs blocking and throttling content and services to consumers.,HighSpeed Office Limited
In their push against the OIO opponents of NetNeutrality described the bright-line protections as part of a burdensome regulatory regime.,HighSpeed Office Limited
To stir partisan sentiment Senator Ted Cruz (R – TX) even went so far as to call it “Obamacare for the Internet.” But the NetNeutrality safeguards simply preserve the environment that has allowed the internet to develop as an engine for societal change and economic growth.,HighSpeed Office Limited
As a regulator he voted reliably against many policy proposals by former Democratic Chairman Tom Wheeler including the contentious and high-profile move to establish so-called NetNeutrality rules.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Under Wheeler the FCC moved to impose the no-blocking no-throttling and no-discrimination rules on Internet service providers in a way that put them under the strictest-ever regulatory regime.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Though the NetNeutrality rules — after years in limbo — have now been affirmed in court Pai and his fellow Republican FCC commissioner Mike O'Rielly have indicated plans to revisit those Internet regulations as well as other FCC rules.,HighSpeed Office Limited
With federal policy debates currently dominated by tax-and-spending issues along with immigration one might easily lose sight of the relatively recent dramatic shift in FCC (FCC) policy on NetNeutrality.,HighSpeed Office Limited
In part this is because the 2017 FCC order changing the rules on NetNeutrality has yet to take full effect.,HighSpeed Office Limited
That gives legal force to limited elements of the order but most of its provisions including the most significant ones overturning NetNeutrality protections will not become official until the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approves data collection requirements involved in the order’s implementation.,HighSpeed Office Limited
The continuing delay in full implementation of the order however leaves both advocates and detractors of NetNeutrality in a short-term limbo knowing what is coming but limited in their next moves until OMB finishes working its bureaucratic magic.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Fortunately this delay provides room to reflect on the importance of NetNeutrality to higher education.,HighSpeed Office Limited
It also allows for consideration of how the FCC order overturning NetNeutrality protections merely concludes the start of the latest cycle in a long-running argument.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Before diving into the current process it helps to define the concept of “NetNeutrality.” Simply put it encompasses the idea that all internet service providers (ISPs) serving the general public should treat all data crossing their networks equally subject to reasonable network management practices.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Known as “PaidPrioritization” such a practice would give Netflix a competitive advantage while limiting the end-user’s choice of video services since video streams that are transmitted more slowly may make the service to which they are related less functional.,HighSpeed Office Limited
While the concept of “NetNeutrality” includes the principle of “no PaidPrioritization” it also encompasses the principles of “no blocking” and “no throttling” too.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Just as treating all data equally means that a company should not be able to pay to have its data transmitted faster than data from other providers it also means that an ISP should not be able to block the data traffic of any lawful provider from reaching an end-user nor should the ISP be able to slow (or throttle) the traffic from any lawful provider as it transits the ISP’s network except as necessary to ensure that the network doesn’t crash for example.,HighSpeed Office Limited
(This is the other side of the earlier example – in the absence of NetNeutrality an ISP that owns a video service might seek to gain a competitive advantaged by deliberately blocking or slowing video streaming from sources other than its service.),HighSpeed Office Limited
EDUCAUSE the association for the higher education IT community has long partnered with its fellow higher education and library associations to ensure that the importance of NetNeutrality to our communities is understood in federal policymaking circles.,HighSpeed Office Limited
We actively participated in the 2014-15 FCC process that led to strong NetNeutrality rules where the then-final order acknowledged the contributions of higher education and library groups.,HighSpeed Office Limited
When the current FCC chairman Ajit Pai announced last year that the Republican majority on the Commission would seek to overturn the 2015 rules we again helped to organize an association coalition to highlight the problems that a loss of NetNeutrality would pose for higher education and libraries.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Across both FCC proceedings and in fact dating back to the dawn of NetNeutrality under then-FCC Chairman Michael Powell during the George W. Bush Administration higher education and libraries have had very consistent concerns in relation to NetNeutrality.,HighSpeed Office Limited
This need makes the possibility that ISPs might freely implement PaidPrioritization or blocking/throttling measures a major challenge to our ability to serve our students and communities.,HighSpeed Office Limited
If PaidPrioritization reigns we could easily see colleges universities and libraries priced out of the market for effective delivery of their online content as entertainment companies bid up the cost.,HighSpeed Office Limited
As financial incentives drive ISPs to focus more and more on facilitating prioritized delivery of content from providers that pay for it however the bandwidth available over home and mobile connections for “everything else” could become more and more constrained.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Likewise as ISPs search for new sources of revenue the ability to block or throttle data traffic to home and mobile users could provide an irresistible means of driving new revenue when combined with ISP-owned content sources.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Without strong NetNeutrality rules it could then use its unfettered control of its subscribers’ home and mobile internet connections to block or throttle traffic from competitors giving its higher education subsidiary a significant competitive advantage over our institutions’ offerings.,HighSpeed Office Limited
It eliminates the “no blocking no throttling and no PaidPrioritization” rules established in 2015 and replaces them with only a transparency requirement.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Despite significant evidence to the contrary they assert that the NetNeutrality protections established in 2015 which were enabled by reclassifying consumer broadband service as essentially a utility crippled investment in high-bandwidth networks serving home and mobile users.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Setting aside the FCC majority’s questionable assertions about NetNeutrality hurting broadband investment its argument that dramatic investment growth will be spurred without enabling the worst impulses of ISPs hinges on the view that transparency about ISPs’ data management measures will allow market competition to limit their anti-NetNeutrality behavior.,HighSpeed Office Limited
This outcome of course assumes that sufficient competition exists in local internet access markets to enable subscribers to “vote with their feet” in favor of providers that respect NetNeutrality.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Second one can hardly call the majority of the country having only two choices for broadband internet access a competitive environment that will adequately deter anti–NetNeutrality behavior.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Given that each provider would stand to derive significant additional revenue from their subscribers by not maintaining NetNeutrality it is much more conceivable that they would choose to compete on some other basis.,HighSpeed Office Limited
The FCC does not have the final say however and there is a reasonable chance that the federal courts will keep us from experiencing a truly NetNeutrality-free world.,HighSpeed Office Limited
If the court agrees to issue a stay of the FCC order pending the outcome of the case or cases—it may decide to consolidate the separate filings into one—then the 2015 NetNeutrality rules will remain in effect until the court rules.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Keeping the rules on the books though would probably deter the most serious ISP efforts at bypassing NetNeutrality pending the outcome of the legal process.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Likewise a number of states have initiated efforts to maintain NetNeutrality that may circumvent the FCC’s attempt to block such state action.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Rather than trying to pass state laws setting NetNeutrality rules that conflict with the FCC order states such as Montana New Jersey and New York have mandated that contracts for supplying state agencies with telecommunications services only go to companies that adhere to strong NetNeutrality rules.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Congress could settle the issue of NetNeutrality by passing new legislation to enshrine relevant protections in law.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Congress lacks a consensus on how to proceed particularly regarding the thorny question of whether any form of PaidPrioritization should be allowed and it already has a full calendar of contentious issues.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Given that the mid-terms will similarly impact who can demand what in terms of a compromise we probably will not see a legislative “fix” for NetNeutrality until 2019 at the earliest.,HighSpeed Office Limited
In the meantime the courts and the states provide hope that NetNeutrality will be maintained as it must be to sustain the vital public interests served by colleges universities and libraries.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Higher education and library associations remain committed to advancing NetNeutrality to the extent possible whether that means lending support to lawsuits seeking to overturn the 2017 FCC order or reminding policymakers of the important stakes for our communities in any legislative solutions.,HighSpeed Office Limited
The beginning of the latest round in the NetNeutrality debate has ended but the debate itself is far from over.,HighSpeed Office Limited
My first post on  “NetNeutrality”  asked some questions.,HighSpeed Office Limited
This post is about trying to nail down some basics and extracting key findings from the FCC’s two rulings on “NetNeutrality”.,HighSpeed Office Limited
A third post will follow which will define my position on the question before the legislature — state law to assure “NetNeutrality”.,HighSpeed Office Limited
So what did the FCC’s 2015 NetNeutrality ruling actually do?,HighSpeed Office Limited
Finally the Commission continued in effect a transparency principle essentially to cover the notable loophole for “network management” that appears in the blocking throttling and reasonability rules:,HighSpeed Office Limited
Is it a technical decision or a business decision if Verizon throttles super-heavy video users?,HighSpeed Office Limited
However in the 2015 ruling the FCC exerted “forbearance” and introduced only the relatively limited  “NetNeutrality” rules relying on sections 201 202 and 208 of TitleII.,HighSpeed Office Limited
The fundamental motivation of the 2015 FCC’s NetNeutrality ruling was the perceived power of broadband providers:,HighSpeed Office Limited
For example cable providers who also produce and distribute content have incentives to throttle Netflix.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Mobile providers have incentive to block internet calling services like Skype and Facetime.,HighSpeed Office Limited
As noted above while requiring neutrality on the last mile the FCC chose not to require neutrality the connections between the broadband providers and the backbone making the following observations about the state of the market.,HighSpeed Office Limited
And while the dispute is unresolved should the ISP allow Netflix traffic to degrade traffic going to customers who don’t use video or should it throttle Netflix traffic to protect its network?,HighSpeed Office Limited
In the end the 2015 FCC punted choosing not to apply neutrality rules in these agreements but asserted its jurisdiction to regulate them on a case-by-case basis and learn from the experience.,HighSpeed Office Limited
But it stops well short of enforcing NetNeutrality.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Further weakening any rigid principle of neutrality is the “network management” exception allowing blocking or throttling in the last mile.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Is it a reasonable network practice to throttle an overwhelming burst of traffic coming from one provider like Netflix that creates congestion that has the effect of degrading service to the millions of little websites like this one on the internet?,HighSpeed Office Limited
By explicitly prohibiting throttling blocking and and PaidPrioritization of content on the last mile connection offered by broadband providers the FCC  spoke directly to civil libertarian fears that the broadband providers might block free speech and shut out new voices among the currently estimated over 100 million active websites in the world.,HighSpeed Office Limited
On the much more real and difficult issue of how to handle the rise of radically voluminous video content the FCC basically punted by declining to require neutrality on the interconnections to broadband providers.,HighSpeed Office Limited
These considerations may have been in the minds of some of the decision-makers in Obama’s FTC as it decided not to go whole-hog on commercial NetNeutrality but to take a more limited and symbolic step.,HighSpeed Office Limited
This means that they are not common carriers of which the FCC can require neutrality.,HighSpeed Office Limited
No blocking no throttling no fast lanes.,HighSpeed Office Limited
These concerns were compounded by the fact that while the TitleII Order itself announced forbearance from ex ante price regulation at the same time it imposed price regulation with its ban on PaidPrioritization arrangements which mandated that ISPs charge edge providers a zero price.,HighSpeed Office Limited
They review the misconduct instances noted in the 2015 order and find that they were exceptions that proved the rule that the internet access has generally been neutral without regulation.,HighSpeed Office Limited
It is therefore no surprise that many ISPs have committed to refrain from blocking or throttling lawful Internet conduct notwithstanding any TitleII regulation.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Even the head of Netflix apparently agrees that the consumer demand for neutrality is sufficiently compelling to control ISP behavior without regulation.,HighSpeed Office Limited
So for example while ATT mobile broadband would prefer not to be classified a common carrier for neutrality purposes it made more or less the opposite argument in recent FTC regulatory case about throttling.,HighSpeed Office Limited
The 2017 decision removes the 2015 protection for content neutrality sending chills down the spine of all of us who care about civil liberties and want to hear many voices  However the practical change may be modest.,HighSpeed Office Limited
The Obama FCC offered a specific neutrality rule which sounded great to first amendment enthusiasts like me.,HighSpeed Office Limited
All consumers want access to the raw internet and broadband providers have no general incentive to block or filter the raw internet.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Most of the historically identified cases of alleged blocking or throttling have to do with commercial disputes not content censorship.,HighSpeed Office Limited
The best resources on NetNeutrality are the competing statements of the FCC (and the incredibly rich commentary on those statements).,HighSpeed Office Limited
The FCC’s (FCC) Restoring Internet Freedom Order (RIFO) took effect June 11 2018 overturning the NetNeutrality rules the agency established with 2015’s OpenInternet Order.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Since then many individual states and other entities have taken it upon themselves to try to restore NetNeutrality protections.,HighSpeed Office Limited
More than 35 states have introduced legislation to protect NetNeutrality although only four (California Oregon Vermont and Washington) have passed laws.,HighSpeed Office Limited
Several governors have also issued executive orders related to NetNeutrality.,HighSpeed Office Limited
The details of state NetNeutrality actions vary significantly but common provisions are:,HighSpeed Office Limited

December 1st 2016 Cogent's Schaeffer: NetNeutrality turnback won't impact interconnection agreements with AT&T Charter others - FIERCE TELECOM,Cogent Communications
Cogent a company whose spats with ISPs over blocking traffic has become stuff of legend in the telecom industry says that the FCC’s plan to overturn the 2015 NetNeutrality order is a mistake.,Cogent Communications
“It’s almost a certainty on a 3-2 vote the FCC will decide to negate the principles of NetNeutrality as well as reclassify internet service providers as information services and not as communications services.”,Cogent Communications
RELATED: Cogent’s Netcentric business growth at risk from NetNeutrality changes says analyst,Cogent Communications
For Cogent which provides fiber and IP transit services to ISPs and content providers like Netflix the current NetNeutrality rules emerged following battles with eight service providers that would not upgrade their interconnection points.,Cogent Communications
“The regulatory oversight that was put in place in June 2015 was beneficial to us and it helped us go to a group of 8 ISPs who methodically began blocking their customers’ connectivity to the internet by refusing the upgrade the interconnection points” Schaeffer said.,Cogent Communications
Cogent is seeing overall traffic rising in its Netcentric business—the unit that sells connectivity to content providers and other wholesale customers—but potential changes in NetNeutrality rules could cause headwinds in the near term.,Cogent Communications
Wells Fargo said in a recent research note that while Netcentric is growing FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s commitment to realigning NetNeutrality rules might dissuade content provider customers from aggressively rolling out new products.,Cogent Communications
“While some recent trends suggest it's modestly improving we believe the regulatory uncertainty around NetNeutrality/TitleII could inhibit new application development from its content customers.,Cogent Communications
RELATED: Cogent’s Schaeffer: NetCentric customers’ NetNeutrality concerns are temporary,Cogent Communications
The FCC may have to soon consider the first disputes under its new NetNeutrality regulations starting with a fight over Internet congestion and online video.,Cogent Communications
NetNeutrality has traditionally referred to the principle that Internet providers shouldn't block or manipulate traffic once it's on their networks.,Cogent Communications
Netflix Cogent and Level 3 all lobbied the FCC to include the interconnection issue as part of its NetNeutrality rules.,Cogent Communications
"The FCC ultimately decided that interconnection is outside the core of the regulations which bar providers from blocking content throttling traffic or creating special ""fast lanes"" for sites that pay.",Cogent Communications
Matt Wood the policy director of Free Press an advocacy group that fought for strong NetNeutrality regulations said the FCC should consider the complaints based on the exact circumstances in each case.,Cogent Communications
"But trying to then classify it as a 'NetNeutrality' argument—that's just disingenuous.""",Cogent Communications
Numerous factors could cause or contribute to such differences including among others future economic instability in the global economy which could affect spending on Internet services; the impact of changing foreign exchange rates (in particular the Euro to US dollar and Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rates) on the translation of Cogent Communications’ non-US dollar denominated revenues expenses assets and liabilities; legal and operational difficulties in new markets; the imposition of a requirement that we contribute to the United States Universal Service Fund on the basis of Cogent Communications’ Internet revenue; changes in government policy and/or regulation including rules regarding data protection cyber security and NetNeutrality; increasing competition leading to lower prices for Cogent Communications’ services; Cogent Communications’ ability to attract new customers and to increase and maintain the volume of traffic on its network; the ability to maintain Cogent Communications’ Internet peering arrangements on favorable terms; Cogent Communications’ ability to renew its long-term leases of optical fiber that comprise its network; Cogent Communications’ reliance on an equipment vendor Cisco Systems Inc. and the potential for hardware or software problems associated with such equipment; the dependence of Cogent Communications’ network on the quality and dependability of third-party fiber providers; Cogent Communications’ ability to retain certain customers that comprise a significant portion of its revenue base; the management of network failures and/or disruptions; outcomes in litigation; and risks related to the offering of the Notes including that such transaction may not be consummated as well as other risks discussed from time to time in Cogent Communications’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including without limitation Cogent Communications’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31 2018 and Cogent Communications’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31 2019.,Cogent Communications

NetNeutrality is the cornerstone of digital freedom as it will keep the pipes open to innovation and uninhibited development of new applications content and services.,Server Central Network
It’s been a hard week for NetNeutrality supporters as the Trump Federal Communication Commission’s decision to strip neutrality rules from the internet was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.,Server Central Network
And the court said the FCC cannot block states like California from writing their own NetNeutrality laws so that’s where the fight moves next.,Server Central Network
But what really and truly stands out about the DC Circuit’s decision in this case: NetNeutrality at the federal level has turned into a legal quagmire with almost no relationship to the real issues regular people face in the market for internet access.,Server Central Network
The heart of the NetNeutrality policy debate is incredibly simple and easy for almost anyone to understand: do you think internet providers should have the power to block throttle or otherwise interfere with internet traffic outside of normal network management?,Server Central Network
Most people don’t think so — the polls say NetNeutrality is a popular idea with Americans across party lines.,Server Central Network
Instead the legal side of NetNeutrality has become an exercise in lawyers making fine-grained arguments about whether washing machines can make phone calls whether consumers with a single broadband provider still experience the benefits of competition and whether or not federal regulations can override state law if the federal regulations don’t actually exist.,Server Central Network
“Is it good if AT&T can throttle Fox News while streaming CNN for free” never actually comes up even though that is the fundamental policy question.,Server Central Network
But it’s also revealing because it makes it abundantly clear that NetNeutrality needs to get away from lawyers and judges and be written into the actual law.,Server Central Network
And since the court ruled that individual states could pass their own NetNeutrality laws it seems like that’s exactly what’s going to happen.,Server Central Network
The last 40 years of NetNeutrality history have mostly been a fight over whether the internet is an “information service” (like old-school “walled garden” AOL or Prodigy regulated under Title I) or a common carrier “telecommunications service” (like landline telephones regulated under TitleII).,Server Central Network
Brand X is the shadow over the entire NetNeutrality debate and it seems clear that the DC Circuit feels bound by that precedent but thinks it ought to be revisited.,Server Central Network
Regardless of the legal history it really does seems obvious to most people that broadband internet access is a telecommunications service that should be neutral.,Server Central Network
I just want to reiterate that the fundamental question here is “should mobile broadband providers be able to block and throttle internet traffic” and somehow the court has been sidetracked into nonsensical arguments about whether the availability of VoIP services that connect to the phone system determines the answer.,Server Central Network
Verizon throttled the connections of firefighters during a wildfire which is maybe the most obvious way to damage your reputation possible.,Server Central Network
(And indeed the House has passed the popular Save the Internet Act but the Senate won’t take it up while states across the country have passed their own NetNeutrality bills.),Server Central Network
This decision might get appealed and Brand X might get overturned but it’s well past time for NetNeutrality to leave the world of endless court challenges and legal trivialities and just become the law.,Server Central Network
The vote is expected to repeal so-called NetNeutrality rules which prevent broadband companies from slowing down or blocking any sites or apps or otherwise deciding what content gets to users faster.,Server Central Network
Appearing on GLT's Sound Ideas DeKeersgieter said Bloomington-Normal residents have been asking him about what the end of NetNeutrality will mean for their daily Internet use.,Server Central Network
The fight over NetNeutrality is mostly about carriers such as Comcast or AT&T looking to make more money from the content companies (like Netflix) whose customers use the carriers’ networks he said.,Server Central Network
"""If you want net-neutrality principles you've got to write it into the law.""",Server Central Network
“If the NetNeutrality tenants are removed we’re talking about really large carriers that will probably want to go back to certain companies that leverage the Internet to make a lot of money—more money than what the carriers are making—to get a slice of that pie” DeKeersgieter said.,Server Central Network
The end of NetNeutrality likely won’t significantly change the market for Internet service providers in Bloomington-Normal said David Loomis an economics professor at Illinois State University and executive director of its Institute for Regulatory Policy Studies.,Server Central Network
Loomis said he doesn’t think local Internet service providers will have an incentive to move away from the net-neutrality principles in the short term regardless of the FCC’s decision.,Server Central Network
Another is that it’s difficult for regular Internet users to see what’s really going on with their service—if they’re being intentionally slowed (or “throttled”) or if speed issues are being caused by say a Netflix server outage.,Server Central Network
“Even with this information asymmetry (the) consumer would learn the difference over time and switch to a different ISP that does not violate the NetNeutrality rules” he said.,Server Central Network
The FCC’s backtrack on NetNeutrality will shift regulatory oversight to the Federal Trade Commission.,Server Central Network
“If you want net-neutrality principles you’ve got to write it into the law” he said.,Server Central Network
“We’re net-neutral now and would remain net-neutral in the future” he said.,Server Central Network
NetNeutrality regulations are getting yet another remake.,Server Central Network
The 2015 rules enforce what's called NetNeutrality meaning that the companies that connect you to the Internet don't get to decide which websites load faster or slower or charge websites or apps to load faster.,Server Central Network
Filed Under: cdns ev ehrlich fast lanes gordon crovitz losers NetNeutrality OpenInternet shills slow lanes winners,Server Central Network
In particular if there is little competition  all the notifications about blocking prioritization etc are useless as a consumer would have no way of changing  providers.,Server Central Network
Instead Pai has proposed eliminating NetNeutrality rules and eliminating the TitleII classification that could make such line sharing possible.,Server Central Network
So one would anticipate that those miniISPs could constitute a strong check against price gouging as well as against telcos and cablecos deviating from NetNeutrality principles in ways that harm customers.,Server Central Network
I am not actually worried about Netflix and Youtube; they are already well established and they can afford to pay the charges and in any case ISPs know they will not sell many connections if they block them.,Server Central Network
I am less concerned about blocking outright but very concerned about throttling or simply slowing down traffic.,Server Central Network
Finally I wanted to address the notion that NetNeutrality would require lighter internet users to subsidize video streaming services.,Server Central Network
So when I make a network request to https://willbrownsberger.com/understanding-net-neutrality/ 90% of the page which is returned is made up of cached images and static files like .js and .css.,Server Central Network
And the issues are much larger than the NetNeutrality framing.,Server Central Network
So just to start this directly contradicts the FCC’s decision on NetNeutrality — as TitleII is the investment mechanism.,Server Central Network
And this also shows that the companies have already prioritized– not even illegally to give financial advantages to its own subsidiaries–harming all competition  but also giving these companies data marketing info price advantages cross-subsidies on all expenses  the rights of way — a long litany of advantages this is only the surface issues.,Server Central Network
7) These networks should never have been closed to competition and the FCC’s other proceedings from shutting off the copper networks preempting state and federal laws blocking competitors from using the networks privatizing the state utility networks and even making claims about 5G wireless (which are just a con to get rid of the rest of the regulations) — are much more critical.,Server Central Network
As with my situation I know public pressure is a force but I still don’t have a lot of faith in the ISPs to keep their  networks neutral.,Server Central Network
When it comes to biasing some content over others I don’t think the issue is that some content would be blocked but that sites could be made slower or faster — which is a way of pushing people toward some websites and away others.,Server Central Network
I believe that the former NetNeutrality rule the one that the current FCC is overturning is about power.,Server Central Network
I view PaidPrioritization as invitation to ISP’s to put their favored search content and anything else before neutral results.,Server Central Network
Monopoly firms however find more profit from charging more for existing capacity and blocking competition in big and small ways.,Server Central Network
My concern is that with NetNeutrality loosely defined if we do not establish the frame work and principals for access.,Server Central Network
I might agree with you on the privacy issue — much bigger in my mind than the NetNeutrality issue and very distinct.,Server Central Network
I hope you will not let that happen while you’re dealing with the complex issue of NetNeutrality.,Server Central Network
You write “The 2017 decision removes the 2015 protection for content neutrality sending chills down the spine of all of us who care about civil liberties and want to hear many voices  However the practical change may be modest.,Server Central Network

As I look at the net-neutrality issue in general I believe the 2015 Obama FCC ruling was an action in search of a problem that did not exist.,Server Central Network
That has not been my impression from following this issue for several years (primarily on arstechnica.com which is a level-headed technology news site I trust) and the only support you give for it is the FCC justification for the repeal of NetNeutrality which is a source I do *not* trust.,Server Central Network

All consumers want access to the raw internet and broadband providers have no general incentive to block or filter the raw internet.”,Server Central Network
The League also believes that NetNeutrality,Server Central Network
Therefore the League of Women Voters of Connecticut supports the LWVUS position to protect the open neutral nondiscriminatory nature of the Internet.,Server Central Network
To further this position the LWVCT supports efforts by the State of Connecticut to protect the open neutral nondiscriminatory nature of the Internet.,Server Central Network
2017 the League publicized and supported the campaign to defend NetNeutrality.,Server Central Network
Of equal concern to NetNeutrality and actually under state property law control is the practice of local network providers like Comcast to offer property owners and managers of larger projects something for blocking out competition in a development.,Server Central Network
NetNeutrality is the principle of making sure that your internet service provider doesn’t make it easier for you to access one service over another – the Guardian over the Telegraph say – or otherwise distorting your use of internet services just because someone dropped a few extra quid in their pocket.,Server Central Network
Yet in many ways the current battle over NetNeutrality is less a question of broad public-interest internet values and more a parochial telecommunications policy war between US cable and content companies waged on a global stage.,Server Central Network
Nobody can object to aspirations such as neutrality equality and openness.,Server Central Network
Network engineer Fred Baker uses this distinction between voice and web or between “real-time” and “elastic” applications to demonstrate one of the consequences of a rigid application of NetNeutrality rules.,Server Central Network
In the first order NetNeutrality is the Telegraph/Guardian example: ensuring that internet service companies don’t intentionally block or degrade access to legal content or services.,Server Central Network
Second-order NetNeutrality is about the voice/web challenge – the detail of traffic management – and it’s much harder.,Server Central Network
NetNeutrality has been the central campaign point for a grassroots movement of internet activists in the US.,Server Central Network
NetNeutrality is no panacea to walled gardens tethering transit providers that exploit exchange-point congestion and content-delivery networks that outpace the speed of light in giving me access to Google and Amazon quicker than the Guardian or the Greek national library.,Server Central Network
That is much more than simply a “neutral network”.,Server Central Network
At least that's the argument from some people rallying opposition to the FCC's proposal for weaker net-neutrality rules.,Server Central Network
"""The genius of the Internet is that it allows innovation without permission not innovation only after cutting a deal with the ISP and receiving the FCC's blessing for it"" a group of 11 Democratic senators wrote in a recent letter to the FCC urging the agency to enact stronger net-neutrality regulations.",Server Central Network
"""Sanctioning PaidPrioritization would allow discrimination and irrevocably change the Internet as we know it.""",Server Central Network
The Internet's existing inequities are acknowledged both by advocates and opponents of NetNeutrality regulations.,Server Central Network
Kevin Werbach a business professor at the University of Pennsylvania and Phil Weiser the dean of the University of Colorado Law School are both supporters of net-neutrality regulations.,Server Central Network
"Critics of Google (such as Microsoft and Yelp) argue that the government should impose ""search neutrality"" to bar Google from favoring its own services — such as Google Maps Google+ and YouTube — in search results.",Server Central Network
The idea of total neutrality is especially absurd for people who access the Internet on smartphones and tablets.,Server Central Network
Although the Internet has never been perfectly neutral that doesn't necessarily mean the FCC's attempts to police Internet providers are futile — or that the equality gap couldn't grow.,Server Central Network
The FCC first enacted net-neutrality rules in 2010 but a federal Appeals Court struck them down earlier this year.,Server Central Network
His proposal would still bar Internet providers from blocking websites.,Server Central Network
"One of the most debated issues throughout the last twenty years is the issue over
                  NetNeutrality and how the Internet should be regulated.",Server Central Network
"The term NetNeutrality was
                  first used in 2003 by University of Virginia Professor Tim Wu in his paper entitled
                  NetNeutrality Broadband Discrimination.",Server Central Network
"Wu argued that âovernment regulation
                  in such contexts invariably tries to help ensure that the short-term interests of
                  the owner do not prevent the best products or applications becoming available to end-users.â
                  Following the paperâs publication the debate of NetNeutrality ensued.",Server Central Network
"In response to public outcry the FCC passed the 2015 OpenInternet Order in which
                  âit reclassified broadband service as a telecommunications service subject to common
                  carrier regulation under TitleII of the Communications Act.â The D.C. Court of
                  Appeals fully upheld the new OpenInternet rules backing the principle of NetNeutrality.",Server Central Network
"Specifically the approved proposal allows internet providers to
                  block or slow down access to online content and providers to prioritize their content.",Server Central Network
"In addition thirty state legislatures have
                  introduced bills requiring Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to maintain NetNeutrality.",Server Central Network
"This bill âestablishes NetNeutrality requirements by prohibiting internet
                  services providers from taking certain actions that interfere with consumersâ ability
                  to lawfully access internet content including intentionally blocking content speeding
                  up or slowing down traffic engaging in paid-prioritization requiring consideration
                  from edge providers for access to an ISPâs end users and selectively zero-rating
                  certain content.â",Server Central Network
California holds significant nationwide influence over the issue of NetNeutrality.,Server Central Network
"California senator Scott Wiener who co-authored the recent bill
                  stated that âwhat California does definitely impact the national conversation.â He
                  added that âa free and OpenInternet is a cornerstone of 21st century life.â Therefore
                  the California law would be seen as a blueprint for other statesâ NetNeutrality laws.",Server Central Network
"In their complaint the
                  DOJ states that if state and local jurisdictions were allowed to create their own
                  laws with respect to NetNeutrality ISPs generally would not be able to comply with
                  the purposes and objectives of the federal law.",Server Central Network
What are the possible effects of this current legal battle over NetNeutrality?,Server Central Network
"Contrastingly if the court rules
                  that Californiaâs law is not preempted states will be able to use Californiaâs law
                  as a blueprint with respect to their own NetNeutrality laws.",Server Central Network
"Some people believe
                  that allowing states to create their own NetNeutrality laws will create a fractured
                  and unworkable system because the Internet crosses state and national lines.",Server Central Network
"However
                  there is one thing that people on both sides of the debate can agree on: the question
                  regarding NetNeutrality needs to be answered sooner rather than later.",Server Central Network

It is not often that a relatively technical telecommunications policy issue receives as much attention as “NetNeutrality.” The central question is whether broadband network providers — for example cable and telephone companies — can prioritize the data they transmit to give an advantage to the most important or most profitable traffic.,Server Central Network
The NetNeutrality movement is an effort to preserve this open system through government regulation in the broadband age and beyond.,Server Central Network
To its supporters NetNeutrality is a way of protecting innovation by ensuring that all Internet traffic is treated equally.,Server Central Network
But while this “neutral” Internet promises an open platform for garage innovators it also represents a dubious platform for deploying applications that require assurances about the quality of service — for example a two-way video application like a telemedicine application which needs high speeds and low latency (delay).,Server Central Network
But after the Supreme Court ruled in the Brand X decision that cable broadband service was an “information service” and not a “telecommunications service” under the Telecommunications Act and after the FCC (FCC) ruled that DSL broadband service provided by telephone companies also fell into this lightly regulated category broadband network providers were freed to move away from open and neutral networks toward networks that provide enhanced services for an additional fee.,Server Central Network
In recent months NetNeutrality has become a hotly contested and emotional policy debate.,Server Central Network
For example tech guru George Gilder has said a “NetNeutrality measure would just put a stop” to new investment in network infrastructure.,Server Central Network
Within the business community many information technology companies particularly those providing applications and services (including Google Yahoo Amazon and eBay) strongly support NetNeutrality regulation that would preclude network operators from operating enhanced networks.,Server Central Network
In contrast telecommunications companies (including the Bells and cable companies) strongly oppose NetNeutrality regulation; they speak instead of the smarter “Internet of the Future.”,Server Central Network
Both sides have major editorial pages in their corner (with the New York Times pulling for NetNeutrality the Washington Post against it).,Server Central Network
Politically most liberals seem to support NetNeutrality regulation while conservatives are split — with the Christian Coalition and the American Conservative Union for example pitted against each other.,Server Central Network
While there is some political crossover in Congress the issue has largely played out along party lines with many Republicans opposing NetNeutrality regulation and many Democrats supporting it.,Server Central Network
Properly understood there are three distinct issues at the heart of the NetNeutrality debate: transparency blocking and tiering.,Server Central Network
This issue concerns whether broadband providers can block or degrade consumer access to certain applications and content.,Server Central Network
Over time most (if not all) of the major broadband providers including Verizon and AT&T and the major telecom and cable trade associations (the U.S. Telecommunications Association and the National Cable Television Association) publicly committed not to degrade or block Internet traffic.,Server Central Network
Today most policy observers agree that any effort to block or degrade traffic — unless justified by a legitimate business purpose (such as protecting the network) — should be illegal.,Server Central Network
Moreover the FCC arguably already has authority to address such practices — as it did when it halted the blocking of Vonage’s Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service by Madison River Communications a rural telephone company.,Server Central Network
The aspect of NetNeutrality that currently attracts the lion’s share of attention is the question of tiering — that is whether broadband providers should have the right to charge application and content providers higher fees for a higher quality of network service and whether they can provide higher quality of service guarantees for their own applications than for rival ones.,Server Central Network
In each of these three areas the current state of the NetNeutrality debate denies the reasonable concerns articulated by each side and obscures the contours of a sensible solution.,Server Central Network
To listen to some of the more strident proponents of NetNeutrality any violation of the best-efforts principle is sacrilege.,Server Central Network
The concerns articulated by proponents of NetNeutrality touch on an important issue: an Internet where an innovator has to ask permission (and pay potentially significant fees) before deploying a new technology threatens the Internet’s golden goose of allowing innovation over an open platform.,Server Central Network
But proponents of NetNeutrality also overlook a series of important concerns and unintended consequences that could flow from mandating a single-tiered Internet.,Server Central Network
For any company to invest a significant amount of money in a fixed cost asset (such as building a movie theater developing a blockbuster drug or deploying a broadband network) there needs to be a payoff expected.,Server Central Network
In the context of NetNeutrality discriminatory pricing has gotten a bad name in part because network owners have failed to describe their pursuit of new revenue opportunities in consumer-friendly terms.,Server Central Network
Yet to the NetNeutrality crowd even such win-win deals threaten to introduce a new online oligarchy.,Server Central Network
Opponents of NetNeutrality focus on the Internet’s historically unregulated nature; they argue that regulation will strangle its development and prevent the super-fast “Internet of the Future” from taking shape.,Server Central Network
Opponents of any NetNeutrality regulation often maintain that competition between broadband providers is a sufficient check on the possibility of anticompetitive conduct.,Server Central Network
For some critics of NetNeutrality regulation the fact that cable and DSL providers are competing quite intensely compensates for the fact that the broadband market is currently a duopoly.,Server Central Network
Another argument invoked by NetNeutrality critics is that broadband competition even if not truly here yet is certainly going to emerge.,Server Central Network
Opponents of NetNeutrality regulation rightly point out that broadband providers — Ed Whitacre’s rhetoric aside — benefit from lots of applications that ride on their networks and therefore have no incentive to block or treat them unfairly.,Server Central Network
In the case of Internet telephony to return to an example mentioned earlier Madison River Communications resorted to the extreme tactic of blocking Vonage’s VoIP service.,Server Central Network
Looking beyond the Madison River case the anticompetitive tactics that incumbent providers might use are not limited to the ability to block competitive applications but also include other means of placing rival services at a distinct disadvantage.,Server Central Network
In contrast bills calling for more aggressive NetNeutrality regulation would place excessive restrictions on the freedom of broadband providers.,Server Central Network
The many other bills and amendments recently debated in Congress generally represent similarly extreme approaches — with one side allowing an unfettered right of broadband providers to prioritize traffic on their networks (the Barton approach) and the other side prohibiting any prioritization of traffic (the Markey approach).,Server Central Network
Moreover such rules create incentives for gamesmanship such as an effort to have a video-over-Internet service classified as a “cable service” and thus outside the scope of any NetNeutrality regulations.,Server Central Network
Significantly this standard of reasonable access to prioritized service delivery (even for a fee) would also apply to the level of prioritization that existing broadband providers give to their own affiliated applications (say their VoIP product).,Server Central Network
Even port blocking for example might be defensible under certain circumstances.,Server Central Network
Where a new entrant to the broadband market blocked traffic there might be a reason to believe that such behavior reflected a legitimate business purpose.,Server Central Network
For example in the recent case of Clearwire an upstart wireless broadband provider it reportedly decided to block rival VoIP services because this practice enabled it to receive funding from Bell Canada in return for Bell Canada’s exclusive right to offer VoIP services on Clearwire’s network.,Server Central Network
To the extent that Clearwire would not be able to operate a wireless broadband service at all without such funding consumers are better off with the presence of a competitor — even one who blocks rival VoIP offerings — than with no broadband competitor at all.,Server Central Network
It is worth noting that the concerns that animate the NetNeutrality debate are in no small part driven by the relative lack of broadband competition and the low levels of available bandwidth in the United States.,Server Central Network
The issue of NetNeutrality is largely moot in these other nations because consumers enjoy both a greater level of competition and more bandwidth than in the United States.,Server Central Network
In essence the NetNeutrality rules now being discussed reflect a short-term solution in the absence of a longer-term imperative: more robust competition in broadband markets and the building of higher speed best-efforts data pipes.,Server Central Network
And while we await the slow salutary effects of such reforms policymakers should endorse a sensible approach on NetNeutrality — one that protects consumers promotes innovation and patrols against anti-competitive behavior.,Server Central Network
Your time would be far better spent freaking out about the end of NetNeutrality.,Server Central Network
The sites are coming up with creative ways to get their audiences to contact Congress before NetNeutrality’s neck gets laid on lawmakers’ chopping blocks come Thursday.,Server Central Network
It’s in keeping with this week’s “Break the Internet” protests which are similar to the “Internet Slowdown Day” of 2014 when the spinning wheel of page-will-never-ever-ever-load death took over much of the internet as companies reminded people what an internet without NetNeutrality would look like and thereby drove public comment to lawmakers.,Server Central Network
The activist group Fight for the Future was behind the organizing of all these protests and the idea has been consistent: to show what the web looks like without NetNeutrality be it by changing their logos slowing down page loading or by showing fake popups to scare users by asking for extra money to access the website.,Server Central Network
The proposed rollback of NetNeutrality regulations seems to be inevitable in spite of more than six months of reports of fake and bot-generated comments flooding the FCC’s public comments space and most recently a demand from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Monday that the 14 December vote be postponed.,Server Central Network
Fight for the Future organizers have a ton of suggestions on making your voice heard including changing your Facebook status to married and listing your partner as “NetNeutrality.” You can also add a “new job” position to your LinkedIn profile called “Defending NetNeutrality at BattleForTheNet.com” – this will trigger a notification to your network and potentially persuade more people to take action before the vote.,Server Central Network
Check out the protest’s page for all the noise you could wish for and then let your flying NetNeutrality monkeys FLY!,Server Central Network
So is US based FCC going to throttle my Australian destined European originated content just because it happens to be routed via an NSA controlled communications link that is provided by an US carrier?,Server Central Network
Wouldn’t the NSA be strongly in favour of an utterly unfitered internet where no ISP throttles anything?,Server Central Network
For people who don’t know what NetNeutrality is or dont understand what it means :,Server Central Network
NetNeutrality (NN) is a way of removing market dynamics from the Internet.,Server Central Network
Now ISP’s can throttle some users and provide high speed pipes to others!!,Server Central Network
NetNeutrality would equal the government making partnerships with various corporations based on the politics of the president and the administration at the time and they would make deals to benefit the corporations.,Server Central Network
It’s not that they throttle users based on what they pay that’s already the case.,Server Central Network
What they can throttle now is traffic based on content or source.,Server Central Network
As the initial comment period regarding the FCC’s currently proposed NetNeutrality rules comes to a close the Internet Association today released a strongly worded statement calling for strict NetNeutrality rules that would not include PaidPrioritization or what many refer to as Internet “fast lanes.”,Server Central Network
The letter also supports applying NetNeutrality rules to wireless connections and argues for more Internet Service Provider transparency to prevent abuse regarding network interconnectivity.,Server Central Network
The group which counts Google Twitter and TechCrunch-owner AOL as members debases PaidPrioritization as currently proposed as a “difficult to enforce multi-framework that is not focused on the goals of broadband deployment and adoption.” The public the group argues “would be far better served by clearer and more straightforward prohibitions against blocking and paid-prioritization.”,Server Central Network
The group believes the FCC’s proposed “commercial reasonability” test to determine when PaidPrioritization could be allowed has holes — and isn’t actually workable.,Server Central Network
More reasonable action the group says is needed to get rid of a potential flaw or weakness in NetNeutrality rules.,Server Central Network
The Association is not impressed by the argument that NetNeutrality regulation will harm investment in new broadband capacity.,Server Central Network
Currently mobile providers face the same transparency requirements as wired connections but do not face the same rules and regulations when it comes to other aspects of NetNeutrality like blocking.,Server Central Network
In January the DC Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a FCC (FCC) order that prevented Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from blocking and discriminating against edge providers including any website operator application developer or cloud service provider.,Server Central Network
With our proposal the FCC would be able to shift its attention away from authority questions once and for all and focus instead on adopting clear rules prohibiting blocking and discrimination online.,Server Central Network
The FCC is currently planning to propose new rules that would allow ISPs to charge edge providers for prioritized access over others.,Server Central Network
Innovation and competition require nondiscriminatory access for all edge providers to end user subscribers without blocking throttling or prioritizing one option relative to others.,Server Central Network
Categorizing remote delivery services as telecommunications services is consistent with the guidelines set by both Congress and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and would give the FCC ample ability to adopt and enforce meaningful NetNeutrality.,Server Central Network
With clear authority and effective rules ISPs would be prevented from blocking or discriminating against any edge provider whether on a wireline or wireless network.,Server Central Network
I think this is the best solution to the NetNeutrality issue as it will prevent greedy ISPs from discriminating against any traffic on the internet and also prevent them from charging streaming services such as netflix “preferred” access to their customers just so the ISP can make even more money.,Server Central Network
NetNeutrality began as “progressive” post modern fascist censorship and it is no less exactly that today no matter how much you mask it.,Server Central Network
NetNeutrality interconnect peering etc.. are all related.,Server Central Network
In fact NetNeutrality as a concept is both a contrived notion and a farce; invented by those who choose to ignore the history of the 1980s-90s.,Server Central Network
Also this: http://ammori.org/2014/05/13/net-neutralitys-legal-binary-an-eitheror-with-no-third-way/,Server Central Network
It’s my website I can block whoever the hell I want!,Server Central Network
I am an ICT policy analyst and only recently realized I did not understand how NetNeutrality works for small online businesses.,Server Central Network
The idea of NetNeutrality is no different.,Server Central Network
Translation: the only to give the same amount of bandwidth to my dinky little nerd guitar forum is to take away some of the bandwidth that is currently prioritized for Netflix/Youtube/Google/etc.,Server Central Network
Abolishing NetNeutrality in the US was supposedly about spurring telecoms— freed from regulations—to expand and upgrade their networks.,Server Central Network
At the FCC (FCC) it was a top rationale for discarding Obama-era rules that prohibited telecoms from blocking slowing or otherwise discriminating against content and services and from charging for “fast lanes” or giving preferential treatment such as higher download speeds.,Server Central Network
The news comes on the heels of an Oct. 1 court win (perhaps a Pyrrhic one) for opponents of NetNeutrality that upheld the FCC’s repeal but handed states the authority to impose stricter standards—threatening to balkanize US regulations.,Server Central Network
Industry executives when speaking candidly have said NetNeutrality rules do not affect capital investments.,Server Central Network
In 2005 a Verizon spokesman indicated that then-new NetNeutrality principles would not stifle investment stating “Our plans haven’t changed.” AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told investors in December 2015 that plans to expand his company’s network wouldn’t be affected by Obama-era regulations (although he later amended this to say the new rules could be “suppressive to  investment”).,Server Central Network
To answer the question empirically Christopher Hooton an economist at both George Washington University and the Internet Association trade group (no friend of the FCC’s decision to repeal NetNeutrality) dug into data filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.,Server Central Network
“The key finding is there were no impacts on telecommunication industry investment (as measured by new capital expenditures incurred) from the NetNeutrality policy changes” wrote Hooton.,Server Central Network
“In other words NetNeutrality rules were not a strong enough factor to cause ISPs to decrease their investment as measured by new capital expenditures incurred.”,Server Central Network
Ultimately Hooton argues the lack of correlation undermines the argument that the repeal of NetNeutrality increases investment and potentially other claims such as that it fosters innovation or promotes free speech.,Server Central Network
Net-neutrality decisions will now be up to the states per this week’s legal decision which was made by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.,Server Central Network
That makes California’s NetNeutrality law SB 822 which went into effect on Jan. 1 the new battlefront.,Server Central Network
It’s the first state-level law restoring all of the 2015 NetNeutrality protections.,Server Central Network
