December 1st 2016 Cogent's Schaeffer: Net neutrality turnback won't impact interconnection agreements with AT&T Charter others - FIERCE TELECOM,,,
Cogent a company whose spats with ISPs over blocking traffic has become stuff of legend in the telecom industry says that the FCC’s plan to overturn the 2015 net neutrality order is a mistake.,,,
“It’s almost a certainty on a 3-2 vote the FCC will decide to negate the principles of net neutrality as well as reclassify internet service providers as information services and not as communications services.”,,,
RELATED: Cogent’s Netcentric business growth at risk from net neutrality changes says analyst,,,
For Cogent which provides fiber and IP transit services to ISPs and content providers like Netflix the current net neutrality rules emerged following battles with eight service providers that would not upgrade their interconnection points.,,,
“The regulatory oversight that was put in place in June 2015 was beneficial to us and it helped us go to a group of 8 ISPs who methodically began blocking their customers’ connectivity to the internet by refusing the upgrade the interconnection points” Schaeffer said.,,,
Cogent is seeing overall traffic rising in its Netcentric business—the unit that sells connectivity to content providers and other wholesale customers—but potential changes in net neutrality rules could cause headwinds in the near term.,,,
Wells Fargo said in a recent research note that while Netcentric is growing FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s commitment to realigning net neutrality rules might dissuade content provider customers from aggressively rolling out new products.,,,
“While some recent trends suggest it's modestly improving we believe the regulatory uncertainty around net neutrality/Title II could inhibit new application development from its content customers.,,,
RELATED: Cogent’s Schaeffer: NetCentric customers’ net neutrality concerns are temporary,,,
The Federal Communications Commission may have to soon consider the first disputes under its new net neutrality regulations starting with a fight over Internet congestion and online video.,,,
Net neutrality has traditionally referred to the principle that Internet providers shouldn't block or manipulate traffic once it's on their networks.,,,
Netflix Cogent and Level 3 all lobbied the FCC to include the interconnection issue as part of its net neutrality rules.,,,
"The FCC ultimately decided that interconnection is outside the core of the regulations which bar providers from blocking content throttling traffic or creating special ""fast lanes"" for sites that pay.",,,
Matt Wood the policy director of Free Press an advocacy group that fought for strong net neutrality regulations said the FCC should consider the complaints based on the exact circumstances in each case.,,,
"But trying to then classify it as a 'net neutrality' argument—that's just disingenuous.""",,,
Numerous factors could cause or contribute to such differences including among others future economic instability in the global economy which could affect spending on Internet services; the impact of changing foreign exchange rates (in particular the Euro to US dollar and Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rates) on the translation of Cogent Communications’ non-US dollar denominated revenues expenses assets and liabilities; legal and operational difficulties in new markets; the imposition of a requirement that we contribute to the United States Universal Service Fund on the basis of Cogent Communications’ Internet revenue; changes in government policy and/or regulation including rules regarding data protection cyber security and net neutrality; increasing competition leading to lower prices for Cogent Communications’ services; Cogent Communications’ ability to attract new customers and to increase and maintain the volume of traffic on its network; the ability to maintain Cogent Communications’ Internet peering arrangements on favorable terms; Cogent Communications’ ability to renew its long-term leases of optical fiber that comprise its network; Cogent Communications’ reliance on an equipment vendor Cisco Systems Inc. and the potential for hardware or software problems associated with such equipment; the dependence of Cogent Communications’ network on the quality and dependability of third-party fiber providers; Cogent Communications’ ability to retain certain customers that comprise a significant portion of its revenue base; the management of network failures and/or disruptions; outcomes in litigation; and risks related to the offering of the Notes including that such transaction may not be consummated as well as other risks discussed from time to time in Cogent Communications’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including without limitation Cogent Communications’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31 2018 and Cogent Communications’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31 2019.,,,

Numerous factors could cause or contribute to such differences including future economic instability in the global economy or a contraction of the capital markets which could affect spending on Internet services and our ability to engage in financing activities; the impact of changing foreign exchange rates (in particular the Euro to USD and Canadian dollar to USD exchange rates) on the translation of our non-USD denominated revenues expenses assets and liabilities; legal and operational difficulties in new markets; the imposition of a requirement that we contribute to the US Universal Service Fund on the basis of our Internet revenue; changes in government policy and/or regulation including net neutrality rules  by the United States Federal Communications Commission and in the area of data protection; increasing competition leading to lower prices for our services; our ability to attract new customers and to increase and maintain the volume of traffic on our network; the ability to maintain our Internet peering arrangements on favorable terms; our reliance on an equipment vendor Cisco Systems Inc. and the potential for hardware or software problems associated with such equipment; the dependence of our network on the quality and dependability of third-party fiber providers; our ability to retain certain customers that comprise a significant portion of our revenue base; the management of network failures and/or disruptions; and outcomes in litigation as well as other risks discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including without limitation our report on Form 10-Q  for the quarter ended March 31 2019 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.,,,
Last month California State Senator Scott Wiener introduced bill SB-822 which would extend net neutrality protections throughout the state and strike a major blow to the FCC and its chairman Ajit Pai.,,,
"""Free and open internet is critical to our democracy"" Wiener said flanked by Stanford professor Barbra van Schewick and Cogent Communications CEO Dan Schaeffer.",,,
"While defending the bill Schaeffer accused Devine and AT&T of intentionally blocking traffic saying ""They had an interconnection agreement with Cogent [which] they violated...when they felt they could.",,,
"They’re trying to block their customer’s full access to the internet and forcing large-content providers to enter into direct connection agreements that are at higher prices than the competitive market allows and they can do that because of their monopoly relationship with their customer.""",,,
How the net neutrality debate has jostled the stock price of one keeper of the pipes.,,,
Netflix may have been one of net neutrality’s staunchest supporters but the online video company said it is not concerned about the new FCC leadership's intentions to overturn the rules.,,,
Pai who has advocated for a lighter touch regulatory approach has set his key issue around finding a way to overturn the net neutrality rules.,,,
Following its recent quarterly results Netflix said in a recent letter to shareholders (PDF) that its well established relationships with all of the major ISPs means a change in net neutrality won't likely impact their earnings or the user experience.,,,
“Weakening of U.S. net neutrality laws should that occur is unlikely to materially affect our domestic margins or service quality because we are now popular enough with consumers to keep our relationships with ISPs stable” Netflix said.,,,
Under the FCC’s current net neutrality rules ISPs are barred from blocking or throttling traffic from other websites or letting certain web application providers pay for priority treatment.,,,
Still Netflix said that it will continue to support net neutrality as it will help foster innovation by emerging players in the online video and broader internet application space.,,,
“On a public policy basis however strong net neutrality is important to support innovation and smaller firms” Netflix said.,,,
We hope the new U.S. administration and Congress will recognize that keeping the network neutral drives job growth and innovation.”,,,
Analysts said that even though Netflix may be saying they are not worried about a potential overturn in net neutrality their customers could see issues in bandwidth allocation as they migrate to 4K quality video.,,,
"“Basically Netflix is saying they are 'too big to throttle'"" said Joel Espelien senior analyst for TDG Research in an e-mail to FierceOnlineVideo.",,,
“If broadband providers noticeably throttled Netflix data and produced a bad experience you can be certain that Netflix will be quick to point out the broadband providers that are doing so encouraging their millions of subscribers to switch to cooperative broadband companies” Sappington said.,,,
"Although the FCC did not bar interconnection payments the regulator developed a process (PDF) under the net neutrality rules that allows OTT video providers to question whether an ISP’s payment request is ""unjust"" or ""unreasonable.""",,,
Cogent told investors in December that it won’t see any impact on the interconnection agreements it has with its ISP partners like AT&T and Comcast if the net neutrality rules are overturned by the new administration.,,,
The ISPs have replied that Netflix doesn’t have proof of inappropriate activity—and regardless it’s not its business what goes on: “Internet interconnection has nothing to do with net neutrality” cable TV and internet provider Comcast notes in a recent rebuttal of Netflix criticism.,,,
Comcast is right that the generally accepted standard of net neutrality hasn’t gone beyond the last mile.,,,
It’s far from a full embrace of so-called “strong net neutrality”—expanding the definition to include neutral data treatment on the rest of the internet—and it could even backfire for Netflix if the FCC agrees with the ISPs that Netflix is responsible for upgrading its connections.,,,
