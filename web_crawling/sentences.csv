"""But home broadband service and data service on smartphones have been exempted.So why did Sprint break ranks?Feld explained that Title II would not only give the FCC stronger authority to enforce net neutrality but could also help Sprint better compete with its bigger rivals, Verizon and AT&T.Because Sprint has a smaller network, it sometimes needs to pay Verizon and AT&T to let its customers connect to their cell towers.""",Sprint,
"""Verizon and AT&T also operate the landline telecommunications networks that Sprint often has to use to transfer its customers' data.""",Sprint,

"""Historical data shows that making wireless networks faster actually lowers the cost per gigabyte, rather than raising it, and the speed and capacity increases that 5G should bring about will make wireless data cheaper and faster than ever.Of course, Claure wrapped things up with the obligatory lip service to how Sprint, just like everyone else, loves net neutrality.""",Sprint,

Informed news analysis every weekdayNew ""unlimited data"" plans from T-Mobile and Sprint seem at first blush to be a win-win for customers, but not only could subscribers ultimately wind up paying more for less, the plans clearly violate net neutrality principles.""",Sprint,
"""Except by ""unlimited"" the company actually means 26GB, after which data speeds are throttled, and video streams are downgraded to 480p by default.Sprint subsequently unveiled its Unlimited Freedom data plan, which goes even further by reducing bandwidth for video, gaming, and music.T-Mobile's Binge On program, introduced last year, also reduced video quality from 1,080p to 480p; in return, streaming from participating services like Netflix and Hulu didn't count against customers' data caps.""",Sprint,
"""At least Sprint's new plan includes a tethering allowance of 5GB.""",Sprint,
"""It’s already involved in programs that advantage some services over others.Sprint is fairly vague in its stance as well.""",Sprint,
"""Its website says that Sprint “does not block sites based on content or subject, unless the internet address hosts unlawful content or is blocked as part of an opted-in customer service.” So that generally seems to be a stance against blocking lawful content, with an exception for, say, parental controls.""",Sprint,
"""Though, again, this is legally required right now.Aside from that, Sprint doesn’t comment on throttling, zero-rating, or paid prioritization.""",Sprint,
"""And in an email to The Verge, a Sprint spokesperson seemed to indicate that the company would take advantage of these changes, saying the absence of net neutrality rules “appears to allow Sprint to manage our network and differentiate our products.” That differentiation, presumably, being through services that couldn’t be offered before because they violated net neutrality.When asked to clarify, a spokesperson said, “It would be a big leap to hypothesize that means limited or zero-rated plans.”Takeaway: Sprint makes no commitments on net neutrality, but suggests it doesn’t have plans to offer a service that would block sites.""",Sprint,
"""We also talk to Gigi about the Sprint and T-Mobile merger and the issues surrounding how that merger will seemingly go through unless it’s stopped by a lawsuit from several states.""",Sprint,
"""Nilay Patel: And that’s a good time to shift our attention to Sprint and T-Mobile.""",Sprint,
"""In late May of this year, Chairman Pai announced via a statement that he was going to circulate soon an order to his colleagues approving the Sprint T-Mobile merger — this was before there was any conversation about a fourth carrier — and that it would be good for 5G deployment.""",Sprint,
"""So they get 9 million customers compared to Verizon’s 130 Sprint/T-Mobile’s 100 million and they could start to build a business using T Mobile’s network.""",Sprint,
"""So behavioral conditions are, for example, “T-Mobile must let Dish use its network to provide service.” A structural condition is “Okay, Sprint must spin off Boost, must sell Boost to Dish.”So that’s where, basically, you take a part of your business and you sell it to someone else or you give it to someone else.""",Sprint,
"""A behavioral condition is one where you’re saying, “Okay, company, you must be nice by doing X.” So the FCC decision yesterday is going to say something along these lines: “The new Sprint / T-Mobile promises to serve X number of rural people in five years and plans to deploy 5G in 97 percent of communities in five years or seven years.”That’s a behavioral condition where you’re depending on the company that’s merging to behave.""",Sprint,
"""So Sprint bought Nextel years back...Another wild success story of consolidation.A horrible lack of success, and, yes, Dish has the option to buy it.""",Sprint,
"""Now, my question is, if Sprint so desperately wants to get out of the market, why don’t they just sell their network to Dish?""",Sprint,
"""Why wouldn’t we want to strengthen T-Mobile by letting them run Sprint and getting Sprint spectrum and making them as big as AT&T?""",Sprint,
"""So I feel like I’m partly responsible.But when you have four, you had a situation where T-Mobile was not only competing with AT&T and Verizon and changing their behavior, but it was also competing with Sprint and Sprint with it for the low value customer.""",Sprint,
"""Once you shrink that to three evenly sized companies, the incentive to go after the low value customer goes away because you’ve gotten rid of Sprint, who is keeping your prices down.""",Sprint,
"""I think the better solution, the cleaner solution, is to have Sprint sell its assets.""",Sprint,
"""There may be other cable companies interested in buying Sprint’s assets.""",Sprint,
"""I just think, you know, if Sprint sells its assets to a company like Dish or a company like Charter or somebody else, then a network will definitely be run, and it will be run right away.""",Sprint,
"""T-Mobile is taking customers away mostly from Sprint but also from AT&T and Verizon.""",Sprint,
"""The only recent examples I could find were of Sprint reportedly throttling Skype in 2018, and Verizon throttling Santa Clara firefighters for what turned out to be going over their monthly data cap.""",Sprint,
"""The FCC issued an Order last Tuesday officially approving the T-Mobile and Sprint merger (Vol.""",Sprint,
"""Approval of the transaction is conditioned on T-Mobile and Sprint fulfilling the commitments they made in the deal, which include deploying 5G service to 97 percent of Americans within three years and to 99 percent of Americans within six years.""",Sprint,
"""T-Mobile issued a News Release last Thursday announcing that it, along with Sprint, had amended the merger agreement (Vol.""",Sprint,
"""The amendment was added due to Sprint’s declining financials over the past two years.""",Sprint,
"""All of the major cellular carriers are doing something similar in allowing some video to not count against the monthly data cap, but AT&T is the only one pushing their own video product.In November a large study of 100,000 cellphone users by Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts showed that Sprint was throttling Skype.""",Sprint,
"""We can only speculate why Sprint would do this, but regardless of their motivation this is clearly a violation of net neutrality.This same study showed numerous incidents where all of the major cellular carriers throttled video services at times.""",Sprint,
"""This throttling wasn’t as widespread as Sprint’s throttling of Skype, but the carriers must have algorithms in their network that throttles specific video traffic when cell sites get busy.""",Sprint,
"""The Sprint/T-Mobile merger could threaten net neutrality and raise cell phone prices for low-income customers.""",Sprint,
"""Petition to Department of Justice:Please block the Sprint/T-Mobile merger.""",Sprint,
"""Now, there are only four nationwide wireless service providers, and they control 98.8% of the market, with Verizon and AT&T holding the lion’s share of customers.1Now, the third and fourth largest mobile phone operators in the country, T-Mobile and Sprint, want to merge.""",Sprint,
"""A merger between T-Mobile and Sprint will mean higher prices for everyone, especially low-income customers.Tell the DOJ: Block the Sprint/T-Mobile merger!This merger would remove Sprint, the cheapest provider, from the market.""",Sprint,
"""Currently, T-Mobile and Sprint compete fiercely for customers on the lower end of the wireless market, which means lower prices for the people who need them the most.But consolidating the wireless service market into three major players would mean higher prices for everyone.""",Sprint,
"""Stop the Sprint/T-Mobile merger!Finally, a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile presents a threat to net neutrality, especially as more and more people access the internet solely or primarily through their smartphone.As wireless companies become bigger with fewer competitors, they will have more and more resources and incentives to prioritize and speed up their own content, while slowing everybody else’s down.That’s why the Justice Department needs to hear from you.""",Sprint,
"""Tell the DOJ to block the Sprint/T-Mobile merger!""",Sprint,
"""BGR, “The nightmare Sprint-T-Mobile merger could be back on,” April 10, 2018.""",Sprint,

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai at an FCC meeting in 2017Jacquelyn Martin/AP/ShutterstockThree senators have accused AT&T of ignoring net neutrality principles by not counting the use of its new HBO Max streaming service against its customers’ data caps.""",AT&T,
"""AT&T data customers who use competing streamers, such as Netflix and Disney+, will have that usage counted against their data caps.Democratic senators Edward Markey, Richard Blumenthal, and Ron Wyden published a letter to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson regarding the telecom giant’s decision on Thursday.""",AT&T,
"""The move favors AT&T customers who use its own streaming service, which would’ve been illegal under the net neutrality rules that the Ajit Pai-led Federal Communications Commission repealed in 2018.For example, an AT&T customer with a one gigabyte data plan could stream as much HBO Max as they’d like without it contributing to their data cap.""",AT&T,
"""Meanwhile, AT&T customers with unlimited data plans will not be subject to throttling if they hit their “soft” data caps by streaming a large amount of HBO Max.""",AT&T,
"""An unnamed AT&T executive told the publication that HBO Max was using AT&T’s “sponsored data” program, which allows companies to pay AT&T to excuse their services from AT&T’s data caps.""",AT&T,
"""As AT&T owns HBO Max, it is essentially paying nothing for the privilege.""",AT&T,
"""While competitors such as Netflix could theoretically buy into AT&T’s “sponsored data” program, it would cost them money.""",AT&T,
"""The Verge reported that the only video platforms that use the “sponsored data” program are DirecTV, U-Verse, and Fullscreen, which are all owned by AT&T.Spokespersons for AT&T and WarnerMedia, the company behind HBO Max, did not return requests for comment.""",AT&T,
"""“Although your company has repeatedly stated publicly that it supports legally binding net neutrality rules, this policy appears to run contrary to the essential principle that in a free and open internet, service providers may not favor content in which they have a financial interest over competitors’ content,” the senators said in their letter.Pai, a former in-house lawyer for telecom giant Verizon who closed investigations into AT&T, Verizon, and other wireless providers after President Donald Trump designated him as the FCC chairman, and the FCC successfully dismantled the nation’s net neutrality laws in 2018.""",AT&T,
"""The net neutrality issue is compounded by the monopolization of internet service providers in the United States, as consumers who do not like how ISPs ignore net neutrality guidelines may not have the option to switch to a competing service, Glaser said in an analysis of net neutrality for Slate.“Since most people in the United States don’t have more than one or two internet providers to choose from for broadband service, if users don’t wish to accept those terms, many won’t have anywhere else to go for their internet,” Glaser said in the Slate article.Though AT&T and Stephenson have consistently expressed support for net neutrality principals, their actions speak differently.""",AT&T,
"""In 2003 AT&T attempted to block its customers from using Wi-Fi and in 2002 warned customers to avoid “home networking” by arguing that it constituted “theft of service” and was a federal crime, according to a research paper on net neutrality from the Columbia Law School.""",AT&T,
"""In 2017, then-FCC chairman Tom Wheeler released a report stating that AT&T’s aforementioned zero-rated video services potentially violated the Commission’s Open Internet Order.In 2018, the Washington Post reported that the Justice Department feared the impending merger of AT&T and Time Warner — which raised concerns on antitrust grounds — would cause such conglomerates to “someday prioritize their own TV shows and other content over rivals.”

"""Discover Thomson ReutersBy David Shepardson3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc urged U.S. Congress on Wednesday to write new laws to govern the internet, seeing that as preferable to future regulatory involvement after the Trump administration voted to rescind so-called net neutrality rules late last year.The repeal lifted restrictions that kept telecom companies like AT&T, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc from slowing or blocking access to certain content.But a future FCC could reimpose such rules, and AT&T and others want Congress to step in and write a permanent solution for a more than decade-long dispute that would likely provide fewer consumer protections.Congress should “end the debate once and for all, by writing new laws that govern the internet and protect consumers,” AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said in full-page newspaper advertisements, reiterating a position the company has held since 2010.While Congress doing so would limit internet providers’ freedom, it would also limit a future FCC’s ability to regulate the internet, a prospect service providers fear in part because they believe it could lead to rate regulations.The Republican-majority U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted in December along party lines to reverse the Obama administration’s landmark 2015 rules barring internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization.Stephenson said AT&T plans “to work with Congress, other internet companies and consumer groups in the coming months to push for an ‘Internet Bill of Rights’ that permanently protects the open internet for all users.”AT&T wants the rules to apply to all internet-related companies, including social media and content providers like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc, which do not support Congress writing rules governing their conduct.The Internet Association, which represents companies like Facebook and Google, said in a statement it “is impossible to believe that AT&T is serious when they have such a long track record opposing consumer protections like net neutrality.”A public backlash to the repeal, especially among younger people, has raised concerns among some politicians about how the issue might play out in the 2018 congressional elections.Republican Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee, said he has offered to codify some of the consumer protections net neutrality advocates want, “as long as the regulation is sensible,” but said it will be hard to get a compromise with Democrats reluctant to come to the table.A planned Senate vote on whether to let the FCC repeal stand “gets you nowhere,” Thune said, calling it a “shiny object.” Even if it passes the Senate, it will not pass the House, “and the president is not going to sign it.”Editing by Chris Sanders and Meredith MazzilliOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.""",AT&T,

"""Discover Thomson ReutersBy Julia Fioretti4 Min ReadBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Exempting some online applications, such as Facebook, from consumers’ monthly data caps and treating them as free is seen as the next front in a battle over how telecoms operators can manage the traffic on their networks as regulators prepare to enforce Europe’s first-ever “net neutrality” rules.BEREC, the body comprising the European Union’s 28 telecoms regulators, on Monday produced a set of draft guidelines on implementing the net neutrality rules which require operators such as Orange, Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica to treat all Internet traffic equally.Deciding whether operators should be allowed to devote part of their network to certain services, such as remote healthcare, will be much simpler than deciding whether offering content for free, such as Facebook and Spotify, breaches the principle of net neutrality, Sebastien Soriano, head of France’s telecoms regulator ARCEP, told Reuters.“This is really in the grey area of the regulation,” Soriano, who will preside over BEREC next year, said.The EU’s net neutrality rules, agreed last year, neither explicitly allow the practice of zero-rating - exempting certain applications from a customer’s data allowance - nor forbid it, leaving regulators in a bind.Some countries, such as the Netherlands, Slovenia and India, have banned zero-rating on the grounds that it violates the principle of net neutrality and gives some applications an unfair competitive advantage.“Zero-rating allows ISPs (Internet service providers) to make certain applications more attractive than others, thereby picking winners and losers online,” the European Digital Rights association said.Telecoms operators argue that zero-rating is beneficial for consumers and can be used to give low-income customers improved Internet access, much like Facebook Inc’s attempt to offer its own social network and messaging service for free in India.BEREC’s guidelines say that regulators should decide whether zero-rating is allowed depending on the market share of both the operator and the company providing the free content.Soriano said that as a result, the issue will have to be treated on a case-by-case basis.“Maybe in one country, one practice of zero-rating will be OK considering the market shares of the operators or the partners ... and in other countries it will raise many problems.”For example, treating a music service such as Spotify as free and therefore exempting it from a customer’s data allowance “creates an economic incentive to use that music application instead of competing ones,” the guidelines say.BEREC said that blocking access to all content except that which is treated as free once a customer hits his data cap will be forbidden.But sponsored data, whereby content providers such as Spotify or Netflix pay operators to deliver their services for free, raises more difficult issues because no content is actually being blocked.“Technically all the traffic is treated in the same way, but at the tariff level, some services are untariffed and others are,” Soriano said.""",Telefonica,
"""Nonetheless, FCC’s Pai argued that he proposed to overturn the net neutrality rules because there were only “isolated examples” of harm to consumers that would justify the FCC’s prohibitions on blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization.The main companies affected by net neutrality rules are broadband service providers such as Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone or Telefonica in Europe, and Comcast, Charter, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint in the U.S; application, service and content providers such as Facebook, Google and Netflix globally; and technology companies such as Cisco and Nokia.The Internet Association, a Washington, D.C.-based lobby representing the world’s leading internet companies such as Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, e-bay, Dropbox, Microsoft and PayPal wants the 2015 Open Internet Order prohibiting blocking, throttling and prioritizing to be enforced.""",Telefonica,
