""" BT Wholesale sells to a range of ISPs, including BT's own.""",British Telecom,
"""Providers can also skip BT Wholesale and deal with Openreach directly.""",British Telecom,

""" By October, BT publicly downplayed the misadventure as “inappropriate management behavior” that would cost the company £145 million.""",British Telecom,
"""Tucked away in a broader restatement by the company about its accounting problems was an admission that £225 million of the £400 million slashed from the company’s EBITDA forecast for the coming fiscal year was the result of a broadly declining business selling telecom products and services to large European corporations.""",British Telecom,

""" In 2006, TalkTalk — a major British ISP — even gave away broadband service for free in a promotion to consumers willing to cover BT’s telephone line rental charges.""",British Telecom,

""" But it eventually proved more effective to encourage competition by forcing BT to allow other companies to share its phone lines to individual premises - this is known as local loop unbundling.""",British Telecom,
""" Should we therefore even be attempting to regulate the services, or how those services are delivered, or the companies that deliver them? 
It is interesting, for instance, to note that we continue to regulate BT Openreach (access to BT's copper wire monopoly in delivering bits and bytes to the home) but we do not directly regulate Virgin Media's similar fibre-optic cable monopoly.""",British Telecom,
""" As long ago as 2005, Nicholas Economides was arguing that ""Making effective use of elements of market organization in many telecommunications contexts often requires considerable and detailed regulation.""",British Telecom,

"""It was unfortunate that Government Minister Ed Vaizey intervened in the issue in September 2015 when he announced that he was 'a sceptic' about the need to split BT and Openreach, arguing that 'full separation would be an enormous undertaking, incredibly time consuming [and have] lots of potential to backfire'.""",British Telecom,
""" The main problem would be disentangling BT's software systems but critics noted that Lloyds Bank had managed to spin off TSB relatively quickly once it had resolved to do so.""",British Telecom,
""" Ofcom announced in March 2017 that BT had (under pressure) agreed to take a further step towards full separation by spinning Openreach off into a legally separate entity with special governance arrangements.""",British Telecom,

""" BT will also continue to set Openreach's budget.""",British Telecom,
