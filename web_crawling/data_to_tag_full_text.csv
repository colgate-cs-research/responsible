"""We at Cogent support Net Neutrality – no blocking or throttling of traffic, no paid prioritization of traffic, full access to all lawful content on the Internet, and free flowing interconnection among Internet providers. Recently, the Federal Communications Commission rescinded its rules enforcing Net Neutrality. We think that is bad for Internet users and for the Internet.Cogent practices net neutrality. We do not prioritize packet transmissions on the basis of the content of the packet, the customer or network that is the source of the packet, or the customer or network that is the recipient of the packet. Where there are network problems such as congestion at interconnection points or fiber cuts we implement network management tools to minimize harm to the users of our network.It is Cogent's belief that both the customer and the Internet as a whole are best served if the application layer remains independent from the network. Innovation in the development of new applications is fueled by the individual's ability to reach as many people as possible without regard to complicated gating factors such as tiered pricing or bandwidth structures used by legacy service providers.Applications proliferate in a free market economy which is the Internet today.Click here to access Cogent's ""Open Internet Access"" disclosures per EU regulations.Products & ServicesCustomer ServiceNetworkCogent CommunicationsCogent is one of the world's largest Internet Service Providers, delivering high quality Internet, Ethernet and Colocation services to over 88,500 Enterprise and NetCentric customers.

"""Cogent, a company whose spats with ISPs over blocking traffic has become stuff of legend in the telecom industry, says that the FCC’s plan to overturn the 2015 net neutrality order is a mistake.Dave Schaeffer, CEO of Cogent at UBS' 45th Annual Global Media and Communications Conference, told investors that the regulator’s pending decision will have a rippling effect on the overall internet.“I think this is a bad thing for the entire internet ecosystem,” Schaeffer said. “It’s almost a certainty on a 3-2 vote, the FCC will decide to negate the principles of net neutrality as well as reclassify internet service providers as information services and not as communications services.”  RELATED: Cogent’s Netcentric business growth at risk from net neutrality changes, says analystThe FCC will vote on reclassifying ISPs under Title I of the Telecom Act during its upcoming monthly meeting. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai will present a repeal for the program, put in place by his predecessor Tom Wheeler, that prevents paid content prioritization and other schemes that would create ""fast"" and ""slow"" lanes for internet content.Right before the Thanksgiving holiday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai circulated a Report and Order on Restoring Internet Freedom, which would reverse the agency’s 2015 decision to regulate broadband internet access service under Title II of the Communications Act.For Cogent, which provides fiber and IP transit services to ISPs and content providers like Netflix, the current net neutrality rules emerged following battles with eight service providers that would not upgrade their interconnection points.By not upgrading these interconnection points, these providers made it more difficult for consumers to access applications like Netflix, one of Cogent’s largest customers.“The regulatory oversight that was put in place in June 2015 was beneficial to us and it helped us go to a group of 8 ISPs who methodically began blocking their customers’ connectivity to the internet by refusing the upgrade the interconnection points,” Schaeffer said. “In doing so they were looking to harm some of our customers, particularly some of our largest video customers.”Under the terms of these contracts, these providers are required to make necessary upgrades. Other than Deutsche Telekom, which Cogent has sued, the remaining seven providers have all abided by the terms of the contracts.In reclassifying ISPs under Title II of the Communications Act, the FCC was able to bring a sheriff into the room that allowed Cogent to enter into multi-year contracts to exchange traffic and required each provider to upgrade their networks.“With the FCC’s 2015 internet order, our problems have gone away,” Schaeffer said. “Even if the current rules are overturned, we have adequate interconnection.”Schaeffer added that reclassifying ISPs under Title I will harm consumers by giving these providers more control over network connectivity.“What these rules will allow companies to do is choose whether for their end users will have adequate connections,” Schaeffer said. “We think that’s a bad idea and we also believe these rules will be challenged and will be reverted back to where they are now.”

"""Cogent is seeing overall traffic rising in its Netcentric business—the unit that sells connectivity to content providers and other wholesale customers—but potential changes in net neutrality rules could cause headwinds in the near term.Wells Fargo said in a recent research note that while Netcentric is growing, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s commitment to realigning net neutrality rules might dissuade content provider customers from aggressively rolling out new products.“CCOI's traffic growth—a major driver of its Netcentric business—has been ~25-30% in 1H2017, well below its historical average of ~50%,” Wells Fargo said in a research note. “While some recent trends suggest it's modestly improving, we believe the regulatory uncertainty around net neutrality/Title II could inhibit new application development from its content customers. This near-term headwind, coupled with new contract pricing that continues to fall ~20-30% per year, will make it difficult to achieve ~8% Netcentric revenue growth in FY2017 and FY2018, in our view.”RELATED: Cogent’s Schaeffer: NetCentric customers’ net neutrality concerns are temporaryDuring the second quarter, Cogent reported that NetCentric revenue grew 6.1% year-over-year, up from the 3.8% increase the service provider saw in the first quarter. As of the end of the quarter, Cogent had a total of 31,262 NetCentric customer connections. At that time, the service provider noted that NetCentric revenue growth experienced more volatility than its corporate revenues due to the impact of foreign exchange and certain seasonal factors.Dave Schaeffer, CEO of Cogent, said during the company’s second earnings call the growth trends it saw in the second-quarter came during what is traditionally a slower seasonal period. “We did see a slight increase in year-over-year traffic this quarter, and what was also encouraging is typically this time of year, traffic growth on a sequential basis is lower than it is earlier in the year, and we experience the same rate of sequential improvement,” Schaeffer said during the earnings call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript. “Traffic growth continues to be driven by three factors, the number of people connected to the Internet, the amount of time they spend online and the bandwidth intensity of their applications.”Schaeffer added that that the company is on track to see further growth in NetCentric over time.“We feel very comfortable that traffic growth will continue to reaccelerate, and we will continue to gain market share,” Schaeffer said. Wells Fargo acknowledged that while Cogent should still achieve decent growth for its Netcentric and corporate business lines, the results won’t meet the company’s typical 12% growth trends. In the second quarter, Cogent reported its corporate business grew sequentially at 2.9% and 11.9% year-over-year.“While we expect the corporate business to remain stable and steady at a ~11-12% growth rate, we believe Netcentric revenues will grow by only ~5.7% in FY2017 and 7.0% in FY2018,” Wells Fargo said. “As a result, we are forecasting consolidated revenue growth to be 9.3% in FY2017 and 9.4% in FY2018—both very healthy numbers but below CCOI's target of 10-20% top-line growth and its historical ~12% growth rate.”

"""Network neutrality, most commonly called net neutrality, is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication.[4][5]
With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge money for specific online content. Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block traffic from specific services, while charging consumers for various tiers of service.
The term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003, as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier, which was used to describe the role of telephone systems.[6][7][8][9] Net neutrality regulations may be referred to as ""common carrier"" regulations.[10] Net neutrality does not block all abilities that Internet service providers have to impact their customers' services. Opt-in/opt-out services exist on the end user side, and filtering can be done on a local basis, as in the filtration of sensitive material for minors.[11]
Research suggests that a combination of policy instruments will help realize the range of valued political and economic objectives central to the network neutrality debate.[12] Combined with strong public opinion, this has led some governments to regulate broadband Internet services as a public utility, similar to the way electricity, gas, and the water supply are regulated, along with limiting providers and regulating the options those providers can offer.[13]
Proponents of net neutrality, which include computer science experts, consumer advocates, human rights organizations, and Internet content providers claim that net neutrality helps to provide freedom of information exchange, promotes competition and innovation for Internet services, and upholds standardization of Internet data transmission which was essential for its growth. Opponents of net neutrality, which include ISPs, and telecom equipment manufacturers, assert that net neutrality requirements would reduce their incentive to build out the Internet, reduces competition in the marketplace, and may raise their operating costs which they would have to pass along to their users.
Net neutrality is administered on a national or regional basis, though much of the world's focus has been on the conflict over net neutrality in the United States. Net neutrality in the US has been a topic since the early 1990s, as they were one of the world leaders in online service providing. In 2019, the Save the Internet Act to ""guarantee broadband internet users equal access to online content"" was passed by the United States House of Representatives[14] but not by the US Senate. However, they face the same problems as the rest of the world. Finding an appropriate solution to creating more regulation for Internet Service Providers has been a major work in progress.
Network neutrality is the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally.[15] Internet traffic includes all of the different messages, files and data sent over the Internet, including, for example, emails, digital audio files, digital video files, etc. According to Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu, a public information network will be most useful if all content, websites, and platforms (e.g., mobile devices, video game consoles, etc.) are treated equally,[16] which is the principle of network neutrality.
Net neutrality is the principle that an internet service provider (ISP) has to provide access to all sites, content and applications at the same speed, under the same conditions without blocking or preferencing any content. Under net neutrality, whether you connect to Netflix, Internet Archive, or a friend's blog, your ISP has to treat them all the same.[17] Without net neutrality, an ISP can decide what information you are exposed to. Proponents argue that this could cause an increase in monetary charges for companies such as Netflix in order to stream their content. [18]
Under an ""open Internet"" system, the full resources of the Internet and means to operate on it should be easily accessible to all individuals, companies, and organizations.[19]
Applicable concepts include: net neutrality, open standards, transparency, lack of Internet censorship, and low barriers to entry. The concept of the open Internet is sometimes expressed as an expectation of decentralized technological power, and is seen by some observers as closely related to open-source software, a type of software program whose maker allows users access to the code that runs the program, so that users can improve the software or fix bugs.[20]
Proponents of net neutrality see this as an important component of an ""open Internet"", wherein policies such as equal treatment of data and open web standards allow those using the Internet to easily communicate, and conduct business and activities without interference from a third party.[21]
In contrast, a ""closed Internet"" refers to the opposite situation, wherein established persons, corporations, or governments favor certain uses, restrict access to necessary web standards, artificially degrade some services, or explicitly filter out content. Some countries such as Thailand block certain websites or types of sites, and monitor and/or censor Internet use using Internet police, a specialized type of law enforcement, or secret police.[22] Other countries such as Russia,[23] China,[24] and North Korea[25] also use similar tactics to Thailand in order to control the variety of internet media within their respective countries. In comparison to the United States or Canada for example, these countries have far more restrictive internet service providers. This approach is reminiscent of a Closed Platform system, as both ideas are highly similar.[26] These systems all serve to hinder access to a wide variety of internet service, which is a stark contrast to the idea of an open Internet system.
The term ""dumb pipe"" was coined in the early 1990s and refers water pipes used in a city water supply system. In theory, these pipes provide a steady and reliable source of water to every household without discrimination.  In other words, it connects the user with the source without any intelligence or decrement. Similarly, a dumb network is a network with little or no control or management of its use patterns.[27]
In a dumb network, the endpoints are thought to be where the intelligence lies, and as such, proponents argue that the network should leave the management and operation of communications and data transfer to the end users, not a government bureau or Internet company.[citation needed] In 2013, the software company MetroTech Net, Inc. (MTN) coined the term ""dumb wave"", which is the 2010s-era application of the ""dumb pipe"" concept to the ubiquitous wireless network.[citation needed]
Experts in the high-technology field will often compare the dumb pipe concept with intelligent networks –also known as smart pipes—and debate which one is best applied to a certain portion of Internet policy. These conversations usually refer to these two concepts as being analogous to the concepts of open and closed Internet respectively.[28] As such, certain models have been made that aim to outline four layers of the Internet with the understanding of the dumb pipe theory:
The end-to-end principle of network design was first laid out in the 1981 paper End-to-end arguments in system design by Jerome H. Saltzer, David P. Reed, and David D. Clark. The principle states that, whenever possible, communications protocol operations should be defined to occur at the end-points of a communications system, or as close as possible to the resources being controlled. According to the end-to-end principle, protocol features are only justified in the lower layers of a system if they are a performance optimization; hence, TCP retransmission for reliability is still justified, but efforts to improve TCP reliability should stop after peak performance has been reached.
They argued that reliable systems tend to require end-to-end processing to operate correctly, in addition to any processing in the intermediate system. They pointed out that most features in the lowest level of a communications system have costs for all higher-layer clients, even if those clients do not need the features, and are redundant if the clients have to re-implement the features on an end-to-end basis. This leads to the model of a minimal dumb network with smart terminals, a completely different model from the previous paradigm of the smart network with dumb terminals. Because the end-to-end principle is one of the central design principles of the Internet, and because the practical means for implementing data discrimination violate the end-to-end principle, the principle often enters discussions about net neutrality. The end-to-end principle is closely related, and sometimes seen as a direct precursor to the principle of net neutrality.[29]
Traffic shaping is the control of computer network traffic to optimize or guarantee performance, improve latency (i.e., decrease Internet response times), and/or increase usable bandwidth by delaying packets that meet certain criteria.[30] In practice, traffic shaping is often accomplished by throttling certain types of data, such as streaming video or P2P file sharing. More specifically, traffic shaping is any action on a set of packets (often called a stream or a flow) which imposes additional delay on those packets such that they conform to some predetermined constraint (a contract or traffic profile).[31] Traffic shaping provides a means to control the volume of traffic being sent into a network in a specified period (bandwidth throttling), or the maximum rate at which the traffic is sent (rate limiting), or more complex criteria such as generic cell rate algorithm.
If the core of a network has more bandwidth than is permitted to enter at the edges, then good quality of service (QoS) can be obtained without policing or throttling. For example, telephone networks employ admission control to limit user demand on the network core by refusing to create a circuit for the requested connection. During a natural disaster, for example, most users will get a circuit busy signal if they try to make a call, as the phone company prioritizes emergency calls. Over-provisioning is a form of statistical multiplexing that makes liberal estimates of peak user demand. Over-provisioning is used in private networks such as WebEx and the Internet 2 Abilene Network, an American university network. David Isenberg believes that continued over-provisioning will always provide more capacity for less expense than QoS and deep packet inspection technologies.[32][33]
Device neutrality is the principle that in order to ensure freedom of choice and freedom of communication for users of network-connected devices, it is not sufficient that network operators do not interfere with their choices and activities; users must be free to use applications of their choice and hence remove the applications they do not want.
It can be defined with the following analogy to network neutrality:
Network neutrality: Neutrality principles are codified ex-ante, and a judicial route is available for redress. Connectivity providers can implement traffic management, but the rules must be the same for everyone. The antitrust alternative, takes more time and offers few precedents.
Device neutrality: Similarly, neutrality principles are codified ex-ante and avail judicial remedies. Device vendors can establish policies for managing applications, but they, too, must be applied neutrally.
An unsuccessful bill to enforce network and device neutrality was introduced in Italy in 2015 by Hon. Stefano Quintarelli.[34] The law gained formal support at the European Commission[35] by BEUC, the European Consumer Organisation, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Hermes Center for Transparency and digital human rights. A similar law was enacted in South Korea.[36] Similar principles were proposed in China.[37] The French telecoms regulator ARCEP has called for the introduction of Device Neutrality in Europe.[38]
ISPs have the possibility to choose a balance between a base subscription tariff (monthly bundle) and a pay-per-use (pay by MB metering). The ISP sets an upper monthly threshold on data usage, just to be able to provide an equal share amongst customers, and a fair use guarantee. This is generally not considered to be an intrusion, but rather allows for a commercial positioning amongst ISPs.
Some networks like public Wi-Fi, or Google Loon can take traffic away from conventional fixed or mobile network providers. This can significantly change the end-to-end behaviour (performance, tariffs).
Discrimination by protocol is the favouring or blocking information based on aspects of the communications protocol that the computers are using to communicate.[39] In the US, a complaint was filed with the Federal Communications Commission against the cable provider Comcast alleging they had illegally inhibited users of its high-speed Internet service from using the popular file-sharing software BitTorrent.[40] Comcast admitted no wrongdoing[41] in its proposed settlement of up to US$16 dollars per share in December 2009.[42] However, a U.S. appeals court ruled in April 2010 that the FCC exceeded its authority when it sanctioned Comcast in 2008 for deliberately preventing some subscribers from using peer-to-peer file-sharing services to download large files. However, the FCC spokeswoman Jen Howard responded, ""the court in no way disagreed with the importance of preserving a free and open Internet, nor did it close the door to other methods for achieving this important end"".[43] Despite the ruling in favour of Comcast, a study by Measurement Lab in October 2011 verified that Comcast had virtually stopped its BitTorrent throttling practices.[44][45]
During the 1990s, creating a non-neutral Internet was technically infeasible.[46] Originally developed to filter harmful malware, the Internet security company NetScreen Technologies released network firewalls in 2003 with so-called deep packet inspection capabilities. Deep packet inspection helped make real-time discrimination between different kinds of data possible,[47] and is often used for Internet censorship. In a practice called zero-rating, companies will not invoice data use related to certain IP addresses, favoring use of those services. Examples include Facebook Zero,[48] Wikipedia Zero, and Google Free Zone. These zero-rating practices are especially common in the developing world.[49]
Sometimes Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will charge some companies, but not others, for the traffic they cause on the ISP's network. French telecom operator Orange, complaining that traffic from YouTube and other Google sites consist of roughly 50% of total traffic on the Orange network, made a deal with Google, in which they charge Google for the traffic incurred on the Orange network.[50] Some also thought that Orange's rival ISP Free throttled YouTube traffic. However, an investigation done by the French telecommunications regulatory body revealed that the network was simply congested during peak hours.[51]
Aside from the zero-rating method, ISPs will also use certain strategies to reduce costs of pricing plans such as the use of sponsored data. In a scenario where a sponsored data plan is used, a third-party will step in and pay for all the content that it (or the carrier or consumer) does not want around. This is generally used as a way for ISP's to remove out-of-pocket costs from subscribers.[52]
One of the criticisms regarding discrimination is that the system set up by ISPs for this purpose is capable of not only discriminating but also scrutinizing full-packet content of communications. For instance, the deep packet inspection technology installs intelligence within the lower layers in the work to discover and identify the source, type, and destination of packets, revealing information about packets traveling in the physical infrastructure so it can dictate the quality of transport such packet will receive.[53] This is seen as an architecture of surveillance, one that can be shared with intelligence agencies, copyrighted content owners, and civil litigants, exposing the users' secrets in the process.[54]
Proponents of net neutrality argue that without new regulations, Internet service providers would be able to profit from and favor their own private protocols over others. ISPs are able to encourage the use of specific services by using private networks to discriminate what data is counted against bandwidth caps. For example, Comcast struck a deal with Microsoft that allowed users to stream television through the Xfinity app on their Xbox 360s without it affecting their bandwidth limit. However, utilizing other television streaming apps, such as Netflix, HBO Go, and Hulu, counted towards the limit. Comcast denied that this infringed on net neutrality principles since ""it runs its Xfinity for Xbox service on its own, private Internet protocol network"".[55] In 2009, when AT&T was bundling iPhone 3G with its 3G network service, the company placed restrictions on which iPhone applications could run on its network.[56] According to proponents of net neutrality, this capitalization on which content producers ISPs can favor would ultimately lead to fragmentation, where some ISPs would have certain content that is not necessarily present in the networks offered by other ISPs. The danger behind fragmentation, as viewed by proponents of net neutrality, is the concept that there could be ""multiple 'Internets,'"" where some ISPs offer exclusive internet applications or services or make it more difficult to gain access internet content that may be more easily viewable through other internet service providers. An example of a fragmented service would be television, where some cable providers offer exclusive media from certain content providers.[57] However, in theory, allowing ISPs to favor certain content and private networks would overall improve internet services since they would be able to recognize packets of information that are more time-sensitive and prioritize that over packets that are not as sensitive to latency. The issue, as explained by Robin S. Lee and Tim Wu, is that there are literally too many ISPs and internet content providers around the world to reach an agreement on how to standardize that prioritization. A proposed solution would be to allow all online content to be accessed and transferred freely, while simultaneously offering a ""fast lane"" for a preferred service that does not discriminate on the content provider.[57]
There is disagreement about whether peering is a net neutrality issue.[58] In the first quarter of 2014, streaming website Netflix reached an arrangement with ISP Comcast to improve the quality of its service to Netflix clients.[59] This arrangement was made in response to increasingly slow connection speeds through Comcast over the course of 2013, where average speeds dropped by over 25% of their values a year before to an all-time low. After the deal was struck in January 2014, the Netflix speed index recorded a 66% increase in connection. Netflix agreed to a similar deal with Verizon in 2014, after Verizon DSL customers' connection speed dropped to less than 1 Mbit/s early in the year. Netflix spoke out against this deal with a controversial statement delivered to all Verizon customers experiencing low connection speeds, using the Netflix client.[60] This sparked an internal debate between the two companies that led to Verizon's obtaining a cease and desist order on 5 June 2014 that forced Netflix to stop displaying this message.
Pro-net neutrality arguments have also noted that regulations are also necessary due to research that has shown low-tolerance to slow-loading content providers. In a 2009 research study conducted by Forrester Research, online shoppers expected the web pages they visited to download content instantly.[61] When a page fails to load at the expected speed, many of them simply click out. A study found that even a one-second delay could lead to ""11% fewer page views, a 16% decrease in customer satisfaction, and 7% loss in conversions"".[62] This delay can cause a severe problem to small innovators who have created new technology. If a website is slow by default, the general public will lose interest and favor a website that runs faster. This helps large corporate companies maintain power because they have the means to fund faster Internet speeds.[63] On the other hand, smaller competitors have less financial capabilities making it harder for them to succeed in the online world.[64]
Legal enforcement of net neutrality principles takes a variety of forms, from provisions that outlaw anti-competitive blocking and ""throttling"" of Internet services, all the way to legal enforcement that prevents companies from subsidizing Internet use on particular sites.[65] Contrary to popular rhetoric and statements by various individuals involved in the ongoing academic debate, research suggests that a single policy instrument (such as a no-blocking policy or a quality of service tiering policy) cannot achieve the range of valued political and economic objectives central to the debate.[12] As Bauer and Obar suggest, ""safeguarding multiple goals requires a combination of instruments that will likely involve government and nongovernment measures. Furthermore, promoting goals such as the freedom of speech, political participation, investment, and innovation calls for complementary policies.""[66]
Governments of countries which comment on net neutrality usually support the concept.
Net neutrality in the United States has been a point of conflict between network users and service providers since the 1990s. Much of the conflict over net neutrality arises from how Internet services are classified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under authority of the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC would have significant ability to regulate ISPs should Internet services be treated as a Title II ""common carrier service"", or otherwise the ISPs would be mostly unrestricted by the FCC if Internet services fell under Title I ""information services"". In 2009, the United States Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009, which granted a stimulus of $2.88 billion for extending broadband services into certain areas of the United States. It was intended to make the internet more accessible for under-served areas, and aspects of net neutrality and open access were written into the grant. However, the bill never set any significant precedents for net neutrality or influenced future legislation relating to net neutrality.[67] Through 2017, the FCC has generally been favorable towards net neutrality, treating ISPs under Title II common carrier. With the onset of the Presidency of Donald Trump in 2017, and the appointment of Ajit Pai, an opponent of net neutrality, to the chairman of the FCC, the FCC has reversed many previous net neutrality rulings, and reclassified Internet services as Title I information services.[68] The FCC's decisions have been a matter of several ongoing legal challenges by both states supporting net neutrality, and ISPs challenging it. The United States Congress has attempted to pass legislation supporting net neutrality but have failed to gain sufficient support. In 2018, a bill cleared the U.S. Senate, with Republicans Lisa Murkowski, John Kennedy and Susan Collins joining all 49 Democrats but the House majority denied the bill a hearing.[69] Individual states have been trying to pass legislation to make net neutrality a requirement within their state, overriding the FCC's decision. California has successfully passed its own net neutrality act, which the United States Department of Justice is challenging on a legal basis.[70]
Net neutrality in Canada is a debated issue in that nation, but not to the degree of partisanship in other nations such as the United States in part because of its federal regulatory structure and pre-existing supportive laws that were enacted decades before the debate arose.[71] In Canada, Internet service providers (ISPs) generally provide Internet service in a neutral manner. Some notable incidents otherwise have included Bell Canada's throttling of certain protocols and Telus's censorship of a specific website critical of the company. In the case with Bell Canada, the debate for net neutrality became a more popular topic when it was revealed that they were throttling traffic by limiting people's accessibility to view Canada's Next Great Prime Minister, which eventually led to the Canadian Association of Internet Providers (CAIP) demanding the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to take action on preventing the throttling of third-party traffic.[72] In October 22, 2009, the CRTC issued a ruling about internet traffic management, which favored adopting guidelines that were suggested by interest groups such as OpenMedia.ca and the Open Internet Coalition. However, the guidelines set in place require citizens to file formal complaints proving that their internet traffic is being throttled, and as a result, some ISPs still continue to throttle internet traffic of its users.[72]
In the year 2018, the Indian Government unanimously approved new regulations supporting net neutrality. The regulations are considered to be the ""world's strongest"" net neutrality rules, guaranteeing free and open Internet for nearly half a billion people,[73] and are expected to help the culture of startups and innovation. The only exceptions to the rules are new and emerging services like autonomous driving and tele-medicine, which may require prioritised internet lanes and faster than normal speeds.[74]
Net Neutrality in China is not enforced, and ISPs in China play important roles in regulating the content that is available domestically on the internet. There are several ISPs filtering and blocking content at the national level, preventing domestic internet users from accessing certain sites or services or foreign internet users from gaining access to domestic web content. This filtering technology is referred to as the Great Firewall, or GFW.[75] In a journal analyzing the political climate behind net neutrality in China, Henry Hu concluded that Chinese ISPs have become a political tool for the country to heavily regulate information rather than providing neutral internet content for its users. In contrast to countries such as the United States, values such as equality and free speech are not considered in the net neutrality debate.[75]
Proponents of net neutrality regulations include consumer advocates, human rights organizations such as Article 19,[76] online companies and some technology companies.[77] Many major Internet application companies are advocates of neutrality. Yahoo!, Vonage,[78] eBay, Amazon,[79] IAC/InterActiveCorp, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Etsy, Daily Kos, Greenpeace, along with many other companies and organizations, have also taken a stance in support of net neutrality.[80][81] Cogent Communications, an international Internet service provider, has made an announcement in favor of certain net neutrality policies.[82] In September of 2014, there was an online Internet Slowdown protest for the equal treatment of internet traffic in which large companies such as Netflix and Reddit have participated in.[83]
In 2008, Google published a statement speaking out against letting broadband providers abuse their market power to affect access to competing applications or content. They further equated the situation to that of the telephony market, where telephone companies are not allowed to control who their customers call or what those customers are allowed to say.[9] However, Google's support of net neutrality was called into question in 2014.[84] Several civil rights groups, such as the ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Free Press, SaveTheInternet, and Fight for the Future support net neutrality.[85][86]
Individuals who support net neutrality include World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee,[87] Vinton Cerf,[88][89] Lawrence Lessig,[90] Robert W. McChesney, Steve Wozniak, Susan P. Crawford, Marvin Ammori, Ben Scott, David Reed,[91] and former U.S. President Barack Obama.[92][93]  On 10 November 2014, Obama recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[94][95][96] On 12 November 2014, AT&T stopped build-out of their fiber network until it has ""solid net neutrality rules to follow"".[97] On 31 January 2015, AP News reported that the FCC will present the notion of applying (""with some caveats"") Title II (common carrier) of the Communications Act of 1934 and section 706 of the Telecommunications act of 1996[98] to the Internet in a vote expected on 26 February 2015.[99][100][101][102][103]
Supporters of net neutrality in the United States want to designate cable companies as common carriers, which would require them to allow Internet service providers (ISPs) free access to cable lines, the same model used for dial-up Internet. They want to ensure that cable companies cannot screen, interrupt or filter Internet content without a court order.[104] Common carrier status would give the FCC the power to enforce net neutrality rules.[105] SaveTheInternet.com accuses cable and telecommunications companies of wanting the role of gatekeepers, being able to control which websites load quickly, load slowly, or do not load at all. According to SaveTheInternet.com these companies want to charge content providers who require guaranteed speedy data delivery – to create advantages for their own search engines, Internet phone services, and streaming video services – and slowing access or blocking access to those of competitors.[106] Vinton Cerf, a co-inventor of the Internet Protocol and current vice president of Google, argues that the Internet was designed without any authorities controlling access to new content or new services.[107] He concludes that the principles responsible for making the Internet such a success would be fundamentally undermined were broadband carriers given the ability to affect what people see and do online.[88] Cerf has also written about the importance of looking at problems like Net Neutrality through a combination of the Internet's layered system and the multistakeholder model that governs it.[108] He shows how challenges can arise that can implicate Net Neutrality in certain infrastructure-based cases, such as when ISPs enter into exclusive arrangements with large building owners, leaving the residents unable to exercise any choice in broadband provider.[109]
Proponents of net neutrality argue that a neutral net will foster free speech and lead to further democratic participation on the Internet. Former Senator Al Franken from Minnesota fears that without new regulations, the major Internet Service Providers will use their position of power to stifle people's rights. He calls net neutrality the ""First Amendment issue of our time"".[110] The past two decades has been an on going battle of ensuring that all people and websites have equal access to an unrestricted platform, regardless of their ability to pay, proponents of net neutrality wish to prevent the need to pay for speech and the further centralization of media power.[111] Lawrence Lessig and Robert W. McChesney argue that net neutrality ensures that the Internet remains a free and open technology, fostering democratic communication. Lessig and McChesney go on to argue that the monopolization of the Internet would stifle the diversity of independent news sources and the generation of innovative and novel web content.[90]
 Proponents of net neutrality invoke the human psychological process of adaptation where when people get used to something better, they would not ever want to go back to something worse. In the context of the Internet, the proponents argue that a user who gets used to the ""fast lane"" on the Internet would find the ""slow lane"" intolerable in comparison, greatly disadvantaging any provider who is unable to pay for the ""fast lane"". Video providers Netflix[113] and Vimeo[114] in their comments to FCC in favor of net neutrality use the research[112] of S.S. Krishnan and Ramesh Sitaraman that provides the first quantitative evidence of adaptation to speed among online video users. Their research studied the patience level of millions of Internet video users who waited for a slow-loading video to start playing. Users who had a faster Internet connectivity, such as fiber-to-the-home, demonstrated less patience and abandoned their videos sooner than similar users with slower Internet connectivity. The results demonstrate how users can get used to faster Internet connectivity, leading to higher expectation of Internet speed, and lower tolerance for any delay that occurs. Author Nicholas Carr[115] and other social commentators[116][117] have written about the habituation phenomenon by stating that a faster flow of information on the Internet can make people less patient.
Net neutrality advocates argue that allowing cable companies the right to demand a toll to guarantee quality or premium delivery would create an exploitative business model based on the ISPs position as gatekeepers.[118] Advocates warn that by charging websites for access, network owners may be able to block competitor Web sites and services, as well as refuse access to those unable to pay.[90] According to Tim Wu, cable companies plan to reserve bandwidth for their own television services, and charge companies a toll for priority service.[119] Proponents of net neutrality argue that allowing for preferential treatment of Internet traffic, or tiered service, would put newer online companies at a disadvantage and slow innovation in online services.[77] Tim Wu argues that, without network neutrality, the Internet will undergo a transformation from a market ruled by innovation to one ruled by deal-making.[119] SaveTheInternet.com argues that net neutrality puts everyone on equal terms, which helps drive innovation. They claim it is a preservation of the way the Internet has always operated, where the quality of websites and services determined whether they succeeded or failed, rather than deals with ISPs.[106] Lawrence Lessig and Robert W. McChesney argue that eliminating net neutrality would lead to the Internet resembling the world of cable TV, so that access to and distribution of content would be managed by a handful of massive, near monopolistic companies, though there are multiple service providers in each region. These companies would then control what is seen as well as how much it costs to see it. Speedy and secure Internet use for such industries as healthcare, finance, retailing, and gambling could be subject to large fees charged by these companies. They further explain that a majority of the great innovators in the history of the Internet started with little capital in their garages, inspired by great ideas. This was possible because the protections of net neutrality ensured limited control by owners of the networks, maximal competition in this space, and permitted innovators from outside access to the network. Internet content was guaranteed a free and highly competitive space by the existence of net neutrality.[90] For example, back in 2005 YouTube was just a small startup company. Due to an absence of Internet fast lanes, YouTube had the ability to grow larger than Google Video. Tom Wheeler and Senators Ronald Lee Wyden (D-Ore.) and Al Franken (D-Minn.) said, ""Internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay the ISPs [Internet service providers] to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumers' homes,"" they wrote. ""Well, it turned out that people liked YouTube a lot more than Google Video, so YouTube thrived.""[120]
Net neutrality advocates have sponsored legislation claiming that authorizing incumbent network providers to override transport and application layer separation on the Internet would signal the decline of fundamental Internet standards and international consensus authority. Further, the legislation asserts that bit-shaping the transport of application data will undermine the transport layer's designed flexibility.[121]
Alok Bhardwaj, founder of Epic Privacy Browser, argues that any violations to network neutrality, realistically speaking, will not involve genuine investment but rather payoffs for unnecessary and dubious services. He believes that it is unlikely that new investment will be made to lay special networks for particular websites to reach end-users faster. Rather, he believes that non-net neutrality will involve leveraging quality of service to extract remuneration from websites that want to avoid being slowed down.[122][123] This theory was confirmed in 2014 when Netflix announced it was making payments to Comcast and Verizon to avoid throttling, slower Internet speeds for particular services or websites, by those ISPs. These payments were described by Netflix founder Reed Hastings as ""an arbitrary tax"" and ""arbitrary interconnection tolls"".[124][125]
Some advocates say network neutrality is needed in order to maintain the end-to-end principle. According to Lawrence Lessig and Robert W. McChesney, all content must be treated the same and must move at the same speed in order for net neutrality to be true. They say that it is this simple but brilliant end-to-end aspect that has allowed the Internet to act as a powerful force for economic and social good.[90] Under this principle, a neutral network is a dumb network, merely passing packets regardless of the applications they support. This point of view was expressed by David S. Isenberg in his paper, ""The Rise of the Stupid Network"". He states that the vision of an intelligent network is being replaced by a new network philosophy and architecture in which the network is designed for always-on use, not intermittence and scarcity. Rather than intelligence being designed into the network itself, the intelligence would be pushed out to the end-user's device; and the network would be designed simply to deliver bits without fancy network routing or smart number translation. The data would be in control, telling the network where it should be sent. End-user devices would then be allowed to behave flexibly, as bits would essentially be free and there would be no assumption that the data is of a single data rate or data type.[126]
Contrary to this idea, the research paper titled ""End-to-end arguments in system design"" by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark[127] argues that network intelligence does not relieve end systems of the requirement to check inbound data for errors and to rate-limit the sender, nor for a wholesale removal of intelligence from the network core.
Opponents of net neutrality regulations include Internet service providers (ISPs), broadband and telecommunications companies, computer hardware manufacturers, economists, and notable technologists. Many of the major hardware and telecommunications companies specifically oppose the reclassification of broadband as a common carrier under Title II. Corporate opponents of this measure include Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, IBM, Intel, Cisco, Nokia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Juniper, D-Link, Wintel, Alcatel-Lucent, Corning, Panasonic, Ericsson, Oracle, Akamai, and others.[128][129][130][131] The US Telecom and Broadband Association, which represents a diverse array of small and large broadband providers, is also an opponent.[132][133]
Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist Gary Becker's paper titled, ""Net Neutrality and Consumer Welfare"", published by the Journal of Competition Law & Economics, argues that claims by net neutrality proponents ""do not provide a compelling rationale for regulation"" because there is ""significant and growing competition"" among broadband access providers.[134][135] Google Chairman Eric Schmidt states that, while Google views that similar data types should not be discriminated against, it is okay to discriminate across different data types—a position that both Google and Verizon generally agree on, according to Schmidt.[136][137] According to the Journal, when President Barack Obama announced his support for strong net neutrality rules late in 2014, Schmidt told a top White House official the president was making a mistake. Google once strongly advocated net-neutrality–like rules prior to 2010, but their support for the rules has since diminished; the company however still remains ""committed"" to net neutrality.[137][138]
Individuals who oppose net neutrality rules include TCP/IP inventor Bob Kahn,[139][140], Netscape founder Marc Andreessen,[141] Sun Microsystems founder Scott McNealy,[142] PayPal founders Peter Thiel and Max Levchin,[134][143] ""Grandfather of the Internet"" David Farber,[144][145] Internet pioneer David Clark,[146][147] packet switching pioneer Louis Pouzin,[148] MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte,[149] Nokia's CEO Rajeev Suri,[150] VOIP pioneer Jeff Pulver,[151] entrepreneur Mark Cuban[152] and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.
Nobel Prize laureate economists who oppose net neutrality rules include Princeton economist Angus Deaton, Chicago economist Richard Thaler, MIT economist Bengt Holmström, and the late Chicago economist Gary Becker.[153][154] Others include MIT economists David Autor, Amy Finkelstein, and Richard Schmalensee; Stanford economists Raj Chetty, Darrell Duffie, Caroline Hoxby, and Kenneth Judd; Harvard economist Alberto Alesina; Berkeley economists Alan Auerbach and Emmanuel Saez; and Yale economists William Nordhaus, Joseph Altonji and Pinelopi Goldberg.[153]
Several civil rights groups, such as the National Urban League, Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH, and League of United Latin American Citizens, also oppose Title II net neutrality regulations,[155] who said that the call to regulate broadband Internet service as a utility would harm minority communities by stifling investment in underserved areas.[156][157]
The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, told the Washington Post that it has a ""complicated relationship"" with net neutrality.[158] The organization partnered with telecommunications companies to provide free access to Wikipedia for people in developing countries, under a program called Wikipedia Zero, without requiring mobile data to access information. The concept is known as zero rating. Said Wikimedia Foundation officer Gayle Karen Young, ""Partnering with telecom companies in the near term, it blurs the net neutrality line in those areas. It fulfills our overall mission, though, which is providing free knowledge.""[159]
A number of other opponents created Hands Off The Internet,[160] a website created in 2006 to promote arguments against Internet regulation. Principal financial support for the website came from AT&T, and members included BellSouth, Alcatel, Cingular, and Citizens Against Government Waste.[161][162][163][164][165]
Robert Pepper, a senior managing director, global advanced technology policy, at Cisco Systems, and former FCC chief of policy development, says: ""The supporters of net neutrality regulation believe that more rules are necessary. In their view, without greater regulation, service providers might parcel out bandwidth or services, creating a bifurcated world in which the wealthy enjoy first-class Internet access, while everyone else is left with slow connections and degraded content. That scenario, however, is a false paradigm. Such an all-or-nothing world doesn't exist today, nor will it exist in the future. Without additional regulation, service providers are likely to continue doing what they are doing. They will continue to offer a variety of broadband service plans at a variety of price points to suit every type of consumer"".[166] Computer scientist Bob Kahn[167] has said net neutrality is a slogan that would freeze innovation in the core of the Internet.[140]
Farber has written and spoken strongly in favor of continued research and development on core Internet protocols. He joined academic colleagues Michael Katz, Christopher Yoo, and Gerald Faulhaber in an op-ed for the Washington Post strongly critical of network neutrality, essentially stating that while the Internet is in need of remodeling, congressional action aimed at protecting the best parts of the current Internet could interfere with efforts to build a replacement.[168]
According to a letter to FCC commissioners and key congressional leaders sent by 60 major ISP technology suppliers including IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, and Cisco, Title II regulation of the Internet ""means that instead of billions of broadband investment driving other sectors of the economy forward, any reduction in this spending will stifle growth across the entire economy. This is not idle speculation or fear mongering...Title II is going to lead to a slowdown, if not a hold, in broadband build out, because if you don't know that you can recover on your investment, you won't make it.""[128][169][170][171] According to the Wall Street Journal, in one of Google's few lobbying sessions with FCC officials, the company urged the agency to craft rules that encourage investment in broadband Internet networks—a position that mirrors the argument made by opponents of strong net neutrality rules, such as AT&T and Comcast.[137] Opponents of net neutrality argue that prioritization of bandwidth is necessary for future innovation on the Internet.[130] Telecommunications providers such as telephone and cable companies, and some technology companies that supply networking gear, argue telecom providers should have the ability to provide preferential treatment in the form of tiered services, for example by giving online companies willing to pay the ability to transfer their data packets faster than other Internet traffic.[172] The added income from such services could be used to pay for the building of increased broadband access to more consumers.[77]
Opponents say that net neutrality would make it more difficult for Internet service providers (ISPs) and other network operators to recoup their investments in broadband networks.[173] John Thorne, senior vice president and deputy general counsel of Verizon, a broadband and telecommunications company, has argued that they will have no incentive to make large investments to develop advanced fibre-optic networks if they are prohibited from charging higher preferred access fees to companies that wish to take advantage of the expanded capabilities of such networks. Thorne and other ISPs have accused Google and Skype of freeloading or free riding for using a network of lines and cables the phone company spent billions of dollars to build.[130][174][175] Marc Andreessen states that ""a pure net neutrality view is difficult to sustain if you also want to have continued investment in broadband networks. If you're a large telco right now, you spend on the order of $20 billion a year on capex [capital expenditure]. You need to know how you're going to get a return on that investment. If you have these pure net neutrality rules where you can never charge a company like Netflix anything, you're not ever going to get a return on continued network investment – which means you'll stop investing in the network. And I would not want to be sitting here 10 or 20 years from now with the same broadband speeds we're getting today.""[176]
Proponents of net neutrality regulations say network operators have continued to under-invest in infrastructure.[177] However, according to Copenhagen Economics, U.S. investment in telecom infrastructure is 50 percent higher than in the European Union. As a share of GDP, the United States' broadband investment rate per GDP trails only the UK and South Korea slightly, but exceeds Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France sizably.[178] On broadband speed, Akamai reported that the US trails only South Korea and Japan among its major trading partners, and trails only Japan in the G-7 in both average peak connection speed and percentage of the population connection at 10 Mbit/s or higher, but are substantially ahead of most of its other major trading partners.[178]
The White House reported in June 2013 that U.S. connection speeds are ""the fastest compared to other countries with either a similar population or land mass"".[179] Akamai's report on ""The State of the Internet"" in the 2nd quarter of 2014 says ""a total of 39 states saw 4K readiness rate more than double over the past year"". In other words, as ZDNet reports, those states saw a ""major"" increase in the availability of the 15Mbit/s speed needed for 4K video.[180] According to the Progressive Policy Institute and ITU data, the United States has the most affordable entry-level prices for fixed broadband in the OECD.[178][181]
In Indonesia, there is a very high number of Internet connections that are subjected to exclusive deals between the ISP and the building owner, and changing this dynamic could unlock much more consumer choice and higher speeds.[109] FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai and Federal Election Commission's Lee Goldman wrote in a Politico piece in February 2015, ""Compare Europe, which has long had utility-style regulations, with the United States, which has embraced a light-touch regulatory model. Broadband speeds in the United States, both wired and wireless, are significantly faster than those in Europe. Broadband investment in the United States is several multiples that of Europe. And broadband's reach is much wider in the United States, despite its much lower population density.""[182]
VOIP pioneer Jeff Pulver states that the uncertainty of the FCC imposing Title II, which experts said would create regulatory restrictions on using the Internet to transmit a voice call, was the ""single greatest impediment to innovation"" for a decade.[183] According to Pulver, investors in the companies he helped found, like Vonage, held back investment because they feared the FCC could use Title II to prevent VOIP startups from bypassing telephone networks.[183]
A 2010 paper on net neutrality by Nobel Prize economist Gary Becker and his colleagues stated that ""there is significant and growing competition among broadband access providers and that few significant competitive problems have been observed to date, suggesting that there is no compelling competitive rationale for such regulation"".[135] Becker and fellow economists Dennis Carlton and Hal Sidler found that ""Between mid-2002 and mid-2008, the number of high-speed broadband access lines in the United States grew from 16 million to nearly 133 million, and the number of residential broadband lines grew from 14 million to nearly 80 million. Internet traffic roughly tripled between 2007 and 2009. At the same time, prices for broadband Internet access services have fallen sharply.""[135] The PPI reports that the profit margins of U.S. broadband providers are generally one-sixth to one-eighth of companies that use broadband (such as Apple or Google), contradicting the idea of monopolistic price-gouging by providers.[178]
When FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler redefined broadband from 4 Mbit/s to 25 Mbit/s (3.125 MB/s) or greater in January 2015, FCC commissioners Ajit Pai and Mike O'Reilly believed the redefinition was to set up the agency's intent to settle the net neutrality fight with new regulations. The commissioners argued that the stricter speed guidelines painted the broadband industry as less competitive, justifying the FCC's moves with Title II net neutrality regulations.[184]
A report by the Progressive Policy Institute in June 2014 argues that nearly every American can choose from at least 2-4 broadband Internet service providers, despite claims that there are only a ""small number"" of broadband providers.[178] Citing research from the FCC, the Institute wrote that 90 percent of American households have access to at least one wired and one wireless broadband provider at speeds of at least 4 Mbit/s (500 kbyte/s) downstream and 1 Mbit/s (125 kbyte/s) upstream and that nearly 88 percent of Americans can choose from at least two wired providers of broadband disregarding speed (typically choosing between a cable and telco offering). Further, three of the four national wireless companies report that they offer 4G LTE to 250–300 million Americans, with the fourth (T-Mobile) sitting at 209 million and counting.[178] Similarly, the FCC reported in June 2008 that 99.8% of ZIP codes in the United States had two or more providers of high speed Internet lines available, and 94.6% of ZIP codes had four or more providers, as reported by University of Chicago economists Gary Becker, Dennis Carlton, and Hal Sider in a 2010 paper.[135]
FCC commissioner Ajit Pai states that the FCC completely brushes away the concerns of smaller competitors who are going to be subject to various taxes, such as state property taxes and general receipts taxes.[185] As a result, according to Pai, that does nothing to create more competition within the market.[185] According to Pai, the FCC's ruling to impose Title II regulations is opposed by the country's smallest private competitors and many municipal broadband providers.[186] In his dissent, Pai noted that 142 wireless ISPs (WISPs) said that FCC's new ""regulatory intrusion into our businesses ... would likely force us to raise prices, delay deployment expansion, or both"". He also noted that 24 of the country's smallest ISPs, each with fewer than 1,000 residential broadband customers, wrote to the FCC stating that Title II ""will badly strain our limited resources"" because they ""have no in-house attorneys and no budget line items for outside counsel"". Further, another 43 municipal broadband providers told the FCC that Title II ""will trigger consequences beyond the Commission's control and risk serious harm to our ability to fund and deploy broadband without bringing any concrete benefit for consumers or edge providers that the market is not already proving today without the aid of any additional regulation"".[129]
According to a Wired magazine article by TechFreedom's Berin Szoka, Matthew Starr, and Jon Henke, local governments and public utilities impose the most significant barriers to entry for more cable broadband competition: ""While popular arguments focus on supposed 'monopolists' such as big cable companies, it's government that's really to blame."" The authors state that local governments and their public utilities charge ISPs far more than they actually cost and have the final say on whether an ISP can build a network. The public officials determine what requirements an ISP must meet to get approval for access to publicly owned ""rights of way"" (which lets them place their wires), thus reducing the number of potential competitors who can profitably deploy Internet service—such as AT&T's U-Verse, Google Fiber, and Verizon FiOS. Kickbacks may include municipal requirements for ISPs such as building out service where it is not demanded, donating equipment, and delivering free broadband to government buildings.[187]
According to a research article from MIS Quarterly, the authors stated their findings subvert some of the expectations of how ISPs and CPs act regarding net neutrality laws. The paper shows that even if an ISP is under restrictions, it still has the opportunity and the incentive to act as a gatekeeper over CPs by enforcing priority delivery of content.[188]
Those in favor of forms of non-neutral tiered Internet access argue that the Internet is already not a level playing field, that large companies achieve a performance advantage over smaller competitors by providing more and better-quality servers and buying high-bandwidth services. Should scrapping of net neutrality regulations precipitate a price drop for lower levels of access, or access to only certain protocols, for instance, such would make Internet usage more adaptable to the needs of those individuals and corporations who specifically seek differentiated tiers of service. Network expert[189] Richard Bennett has written, ""A richly funded Web site, which delivers data faster than its competitors to the front porches of the Internet service providers, wants it delivered the rest of the way on an equal basis. This system, which Google calls broadband neutrality, actually preserves a more fundamental inequality.""[190]
FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, who opposed the 2015 Title II reclassification of ISPs, says that the ruling allows new fees and taxes on broadband by subjecting them to the telephone-style taxes under the Universal Service Fund. Net neutrality proponent Free Press writes,""the average potential increase in taxes and fees per household would be far less"" than the estimate given by net neutrality opponents, and that if there were to be additional taxes, the tax figure may be around US$4 billion. Under favorable circumstances, ""the increase would be exactly zero"".[191] Meanwhile, the Progressive Policy Institute claims that Title II could trigger taxes and fees up to $11 billion a year.[192] Financial website Nerd Wallet did their own assessment and settled on a possible US$6.25 billion tax impact, estimating that the average American household may see their tax bill increase US$67 annually.[192]
FCC spokesperson Kim Hart said that the ruling ""does not raise taxes or fees. Period.""[192]
According to PayPal founder and Facebook investor Peter Thiel in 2011, ""Net neutrality has not been necessary to date. I don't see any reason why it's suddenly become important, when the Internet has functioned quite well for the past 15 years without it. ... Government attempts to regulate technology have been extraordinarily counterproductive in the past.""[134] Max Levchin, the other co-founder of PayPal, echoed similar statements, telling CNBC, ""The Internet is not broken, and it got here without government regulation and probably in part because of lack of government regulation.""[193]
FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, who was one of the two commissioners who opposed the net neutrality proposal, criticized the FCC's ruling on Internet neutrality, stating that the perceived threats from ISPs to deceive consumers, degrade content, or disfavor the content that they dislike are non-existent: ""The evidence of these continuing threats? There is none; it's all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria. A small ISP in North Carolina allegedly blocked VoIP calls a decade ago. Comcast capped BitTorrent traffic to ease upload congestion eight years ago. Apple introduced Facetime over Wi-Fi first, cellular networks later. Examples this picayune and stale aren't enough to tell a coherent story about net neutrality. The bogeyman never had it so easy.""[129] FCC Commissioner Mike O'Reilly, the other opposing commissioner, also claims that the ruling is a solution to a hypothetical problem, ""Even after enduring three weeks of spin, it is hard for me to believe that the Commission is establishing an entire Title II/net neutrality regime to protect against hypothetical harms. There is not a shred of evidence that any aspect of this structure is necessary. The D.C. Circuit called the prior, scaled-down version a 'prophylactic' approach. I call it guilt by imagination.""[citation needed] In a Chicago Tribune article, FCC Commissioner Pai and Joshua Wright of the Federal Trade Commission argue that ""the Internet isn't broken, and we don't need the president's plan to 'fix' it. Quite the opposite. The Internet is an unparalleled success story. It is a free, open and thriving platform.""[194]
Opponents argue that net neutrality regulations prevent service providers from providing more affordable Internet access to those who can't afford it.[156] A concept known as ""zero-rating"", ISPs would be unable to provide Internet access for free or at a reduced cost to the poor under net neutrality rules.[195][156] For example, low-income users who can't afford bandwidth-hogging Internet services such as video streams could be exempted from paying through subsidies or advertising.[156] However, under the rules, ISPs would not be able to discriminate traffic, thus forcing low-income users to pay for high-bandwidth usage like other users.[195]
The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, created Wikipedia Zero to provide Wikipedia free-of-charge on mobile phones to low-income users, especially those in developing countries. However, the practice violates net neutrality rules as traffic would have to be treated equally regardless of the users' ability to pay.[156][196] In 2014, Chile banned the practice of Internet service providers giving users free access to websites like Wikipedia and Facebook, saying the practice violates net neutrality rules.[197] In 2016, India banned Internet.org's Free Basics application, which provides users in less developed countries with free access to a variety of websites like Wikipedia, BBC, Dictionary.com, health sites, Facebook, ESPN, and weather reports—ruling that the initiative violated net neutrality.[198]
Net neutrality rules would prevent traffic from being allocated to the most needed users, according to Internet Pioneer David Farber.[168] Because net neutrality regulations prevent a discrimination of traffic, networks would have to treat critical traffic equally with non-critical traffic. According to Farber, ""When traffic surges beyond the ability of the network to carry it, something is going to be delayed. When choosing what gets delayed, it makes sense to allow a network to favor traffic from, say, a patient's heart monitor over traffic delivering a music download. It also makes sense to allow network operators to restrict traffic that is downright harmful, such as viruses, worms and spam.""[168]
Tim Wu, though a proponent of network neutrality, claims that the current Internet is not neutral as its implementation of best effort generally favors file transfer and other non-time-sensitive traffic over real-time communications.[199] Generally, a network which blocks some nodes or services for the customers of the network would normally be expected to be less useful to the customers than one that did not. Therefore, for a network to remain significantly non-neutral requires either that the customers not be concerned about the particular non-neutralities or the customers not have any meaningful choice of providers, otherwise they would presumably switch to another provider with fewer restrictions.[citation needed]
While the network neutrality debate continues, network providers often enter into peering arrangements among themselves. These agreements often stipulate how certain information flows should be treated. In addition, network providers often implement various policies such as blocking of port 25 to prevent insecure systems from serving as spam relays, or other ports commonly used by decentralized music search applications implementing peer-to-peer networking models. They also present terms of service that often include rules about the use of certain applications as part of their contracts with users.[citation needed] Most consumer Internet providers implement policies like these. The MIT Mantid Port Blocking Measurement Project is a measurement effort to characterize Internet port blocking and potentially discriminatory practices. However, the effect of peering arrangements among network providers are only local to the peers that enter into the arrangements and cannot affect traffic flow outside their scope.[citation needed]
Jon Peha from Carnegie Mellon University believes it is important to create policies that protect users from harmful traffic discrimination while allowing beneficial discrimination. Peha discusses the technologies that enable traffic discrimination, examples of different types of discrimination, and potential impacts of regulation.[200] Google Chairman Eric Schmidt aligns Google's views on data discrimination with Verizon's: ""I want to be clear what we mean by Net neutrality: What we mean is if you have one data type like video, you don't discriminate against one person's video in favor of another. But it's okay to discriminate across different types. So you could prioritize voice over video. And there is general agreement with Verizon and Google on that issue.""[136] Echoing similar comments by Schmidt, Google's Chief Internet Evangelist and ""father of the Internet"", Vint Cerf, says that ""it's entirely possible that some applications needs far more latency, like games. Other applications need broadband streaming capability in order to deliver real-time video. Others don't really care as long as they can get the bits there, like e-mail or file transfers and things like that. But it should not be the case that the supplier of the access to the network mediates this on a competitive basis, but you may still have different kinds of service depending on what the requirements are for the different applications.""[201]
Content caching is the process by which frequently accessed contents are temporarily stored in strategic network positions (e.g., in servers close to the end-users[202]) to achieve several performance objectives. For example, caching is commonly used by ISPs to reduce network congestion and results in a superior quality of experience (QoE) perceived by the final users.
Since the storage available in cache servers is limited, caching involves a process of selection of the contents worth storing. Several cache algorithms have been designed to perform this process which, in general, leads to store the most popular contents. The cached contents are retrieved at a higher QoE (e.g., lower latency) and caching can be therefore considered a form of traffic differentiation.[200] However, caching is not generally viewed as a form of discriminatory traffic differentiation. For example, the technical writer Adam Marcus states that ""accessing content from edge servers may be a bit faster for users, but nobody is being discriminated against and most content on the Internet is not latency-sensitive"".[202] In line with this statement, caching is not regulated by legal frameworks that are favourable to Net Neutrality, such as the Open Internet Order issued by the FCC in 2015. Even more so, the legitimacy of caching has never been put in doubt by opponents of Net Neutrality. On the contrary, the complexity of caching operations (e.g., extensive information processing) has been successively regarded by the FCC as one of the technical reasons why ISPs should not be considered common carriers, which legitimates the abrogation of Net Neutrality rules.[203] Under a Net Neutrality regime, prioritization of a class of traffic with respect to another one is allowed only if several requirements are met (e.g., objectively different QoS requirements).[204] However, when it comes to caching, a selection of contents of the same class has to be performed (e.g., set of videos worth storing in cache servers). In the spirit of a general deregulation with regard to caching, there is not a rule that specifies how this process can be carried out in a non-discriminatory way. Nevertheless, the scientific literature considers the issue of caching as a potentially discriminatory process and provides possible guidelines to address it.[205] For example, a non-discriminatory caching might be performed considering the popularity of contents, or with the aim of guaranteeing the same QoE to all the users, or, alternatively, to achieve some common welfare objectives.[205]
As far as CDNs are concerned, the relation between caching and Net Neutrality is even more complex. In fact, CDNs are employed to allow a scalable and highly-efficient content delivery rather than to grant access to the Internet. Consequently, differently from ISPs, CDNs are entitled to charge content providers for caching their contents. Therefore, although this may be regarded as a form of paid traffic prioritization, CDNs are not subject of Net Neutrality regulations and are rarely included in the debate. Despite of this, it is argued by some that the Internet ecosystem has changed to such an extent that all the players involved in the content delivery can distort competition and should be therefore also included in the discussion around Net Neutrality.[205] Among those, the analyst Dan Rayburn suggested that ""the Open Internet Order enacted by the FCC in 2015 was myopically focussed on ISPs"".[206]
Internet routers forward packets according to the diverse peering and transport agreements that exist between network operators. Many networks using Internet protocols now employ quality of service (QoS), and Network Service Providers frequently enter into Service Level Agreements with each other embracing some sort of QoS. There is no single, uniform method of interconnecting networks using IP, and not all networks that use IP are part of the Internet. IPTV networks are isolated from the Internet and are therefore not covered by network neutrality agreements. The IP datagram includes a 3-bit wide Precedence field and a larger DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) that are used to request a level of service, consistent with the notion that protocols in a layered architecture offer services through Service Access Points. This field is sometimes ignored, especially if it requests a level of service outside the originating network's contract with the receiving network. It is commonly used in private networks, especially those including Wi-Fi networks where priority is enforced. While there are several ways of communicating service levels across Internet connections, such as SIP, RSVP, IEEE 802.11e, and MPLS, the most common scheme combines SIP and DSCP. Router manufacturers now sell routers that have logic enabling them to route traffic for various Classes of Service at ""wire-speed"".
Quality of service is sometimes taken as a measurement through certain tools to test a user's connection quality, such as Network Diagnostic Tools (NDT) and services on speedtest.net. These tools are known to be used by National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), who use these QoS measurements as a way of detecting Net Neutrality violations. However, there are very few examples of such measurements being used in any significant way by NRAs, or in network policy for that matter. Often, these tools are used not because they fail at recording the results they are meant to record, but because said measurements are inflexible and difficult to exploit for any significant purpose. According to Ioannis Koukoutsidis, the problems with the current tools used to measure QoS stem from a lack of a standard detection methodology, a need to be able to detect various methods in which an ISP might violate Net Neutrality, and the inability to test an average measurement for a specific population of users.[207]
With the emergence of multimedia, VoIP, IPTV, and other applications that benefit from low latency, various attempts to address the inability of some private networks to limit latency have arisen, including the proposition of offering tiered service levels that would shape Internet transmissions at the network layer based on application type. These efforts are ongoing, and are starting to yield results as wholesale Internet transport providers begin to amend service agreements to include service levels.[208]
Advocates of net neutrality have proposed several methods to implement a net neutral Internet that includes a notion of quality-of-service:
Founder of Epic Privacy Browser, Alok Bhardwaj, has argued that net neutrality preservation through legislation is consistent with implementing quality of service protocols. He argues legislation should ban the charging of fees for any quality of service, which would both allow networks to implement quality of service as well as remove any incentive to abuse net neutrality ideas. He argues that since implementing quality of service does not require any additional costs versus a non-QoS network, there is no reason implementing quality of service should entail any additional fees.[122] However, the core network hardware needed (with large number of queues, etc.) and the cost of designing and maintaining a QoS network are both much higher than for a non-QoS network.[citation needed]
There are also some discrepancies in how wireless networks affect the implementation of net neutrality policy, some of which are noted in the studies of Christopher Yoo. In one research article, he claimed that ""...bad handoffs, local congestion, and the physics of wave propagation make wireless broadband networks significantly less reliable than fixed broadband networks.""[211]
Broadband Internet access has most often been sold to users based on Excess Information Rate or maximum available bandwidth. If Internet service providers (ISPs) can provide varying levels of service to websites at various prices, this may be a way to manage the costs of unused capacity by selling surplus bandwidth (or ""leverage price discrimination to recoup costs of 'consumer surplus'""). However, purchasers of connectivity on the basis of Committed Information Rate or guaranteed bandwidth capacity must expect the capacity they purchase in order to meet their communications requirements. Various studies have sought to provide network providers the necessary formulas for adequately pricing such a tiered service for their customer base. But while network neutrality is primarily focused on protocol based provisioning, most of the pricing models are based on bandwidth restrictions.[212]
Many Economists have analyzed Net Neutrality to compare various hypothetical pricing models.  For instance, economic professors Michael L. Katz and Benjamin E. Hermalin at the University of California Berkeley co-published paper titled, ""The Economics of Product-Line Restrictions with an Application to the Network Neutrality Debate"" in 2007. In this paper they compared the single service economic equilibrium to the multi-service economic equilibriums under Net Neutrality.[213]
On 12 July 2017, an event called the Day of Action was held to advocate net neutrality in the United States in response to Ajit Pai's plans to remove government policies that upheld net neutrality. Several websites participated in this event, including ones such as Amazon, Netflix, Google, and several other just as well-known websites. The gathering was called ""the largest online protest in history."" Websites chose many different ways to convey their message. The founder of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, published a video defending FCC's rules. Reddit made a pop-up message that loads slowly to illustrate the effect of removing net neutrality. Other websites also put up some less obvious notifications, such as Amazon, who put up a hard-to-notice link, or Google, who put up policy blog post as opposed to a more obvious message.[214]
A poll conducted by Mozilla showed strong support for net neutrality across US political parties. Out of the approximately 1,000 responses received by the poll, 76% of Americans, 81% of Democrats, and 73% of Republicans, support net neutrality.[215] The poll also showed that 78% of Americans do not think that Trump's government can be trusted to protect access to the Internet. Net neutrality supporters had also made several comments on the FCC website opposing plans to remove net neutrality, especially after a segment by John Oliver regarding this topic was aired on his show Last Week Tonight.[216] He urged his viewers to comment on the FCC's website, and the flood of comments that were received crashed the FCC's website, with the resulting media coverage of the incident inadvertently helping it to reach greater audiences.[217] However, in response, Ajit Pai selected one particular comment that specifically supported removal of net neutrality policies.
At the end of August, the FCC released more than 13,000 pages of net neutrality complaints filed by consumers, yet it was released one day before the deadline for the public to comment on Ajit Pai's proposal to remove net neutrality. It has been implied that the FCC ignored evidence against their proposal in order to remove the protection laws faster. It has also been noted that nowhere was it mentioned how FCC made any attempt to resolve the complaints made. Regardless, Ajit Pai's proposal has drawn more than 22 million comments, though a large amount were spam. However, there were 1.5 million personalized comments, 98.5% of them protesting Ajit Pai's plan.[218] 
As of January 2018[update],[needs update] Fifty senators endorsed a legislative measure to override the Federal Communications Commission's decision to deregulate the broadband industry. The Congressional Review Act paperwork was filed on 9 May 2018, which allowed the Senate to vote on the permanence of the new net neutrality rules proposed by the FCC.[219] The vote passed and a resolution was approved to try and remove the FCC's new rules on net neutrality; however, officials doubt there is enough time to completely repeal the rules before the Open Internet Order officially expired on 11 June 2018.[220] A September 2018 report from Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst found that U.S. telecom companies are indeed slowing Internet traffic to and from those two sites in particular along with other popular apps.[221] In March 2019, congressional supporters of net neutrality introduced the Save the Internet Act in both the House and Senate, which if passed would reverse the FCC's 2017 repeal of net neutrality protections.[222]
A digital divide is referred to as the difference between those who have access to internet and those using digital technologies based on urban against rural areas.[223] In the U.S, government city tech leaders warned in 2017 that the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality will widen the digital divide, negatively affect small businesses, and job opportunities for middle class and low-income citizens. The FCC reports on their website that Americans in rural areas reach only 65 percent, while in urban areas reach 97 percent of access to high-speed Internet.[224] [225] Public Knowledge has stated that this will have a larger impact on those living in rural areas without internet access.[226] In developing countries like India that don’t have reliable electricity or internet connections has only 9 percent of those living in rural areas that have internet access compared to 64 percent of those in urban areas that have access.[227]""",,,
"""At least one Internet backbone company is planning to complain to the FCC over network congestion. The Federal Communications Commission may have to soon consider the first disputes under its new net neutrality regulations, starting with a fight over Internet congestion and online video.Cogent Communications, which controls parts of the Internet backbone, is preparing to file complaints to the FCC, charging Internet service providers Comcast, Time Warner Cable, AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink with inappropriately degrading Internet traffic.The complaints would mark a new phase in the long-running and fiercely controversial debate over the FCC's Internet regulations. Net neutrality has traditionally referred to the principle that Internet providers shouldn't block or manipulate traffic once it's on their networks. But the potential complaints from Cogent would instead focus on how those providers load traffic on to their networks in the first place.In an interview, Cogent CEO Dave Schaeffer warned that if the companies continue to refuse to provide their customers ""with access to the entire Internet on an unfettered basis""¦ we would have no choice but to file a complaint with the FCC under the Open Internet Order.""Mike Mooney, the general counsel for Level 3 Communications, another Internet backbone provider, said his company is also ""currently evaluating our options.""""Level 3 is still experiencing interconnection point congestion as some large consumer ISPs continue to attempt to leverage control over access to their users to extract arbitrary tolls,"" Mooney said in an emailed statement.The companies will be able to file their complaints once the rules go into effect, which will occur 60 days after they are published in the Federal Register. The rules are set to be formally published on Monday.   Comcast, Time Warner Cable, AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink did not comment on the threats of legal action. The FCC also declined to comment.Backbone providers like Cogent and Level 3 transport data from websites to the Internet service providers, which then deliver the Internet content to people's homes. Historically, many companies have agreed to exchange traffic without charging any fees. The idea is that both network operators benefit by freely exchanging traffic back and forth.But the expansion of online video—Netflix in particular—has thrown that equation out of whack. Netflix alone now accounts for about 35 percent of all U.S. Internet traffic during peak hours, according to the data analytics firm Sandvine.The backbone providers have been trying to push huge amounts of traffic through connections that were intended for much smaller exchanges. In many cases, that congestion resulted in grainy and choppy videos for customers. The Internet service providers have been demanding payments to build better connections for the traffic. Netflix has now created its own content delivery network to go around the Internet backbone companies and deliver its traffic directly to the Internet providers. But the biggest Internet providers have been demanding that Netflix also pay for those special direct connections. Netflix reluctantly agreed to the fees last year to ensure its customers could stream high-quality videos, but it accused the providers of ""extortion"" and forcing it to pay a ""ransom.""Netflix, Cogent, and Level 3 all lobbied the FCC to include the interconnection issue as part of its net neutrality rules. A Netflix spokesman declined to say whether the company plans to file its own complaints.The FCC ultimately decided that interconnection is outside the core of the regulations, which bar providers from blocking content, throttling traffic, or creating special ""fast lanes"" for sites that pay. Instead, the FCC said it will handle interconnection disputes on a case-by-case basis. Although the main rules won't apply, any interconnection deals still have to be ""just and reasonable,"" the FCC said.In the document explaining the regulations, the FCC acknowledged that it doesn't know enough about these deals on the back-end of the Internet to impose any bright-line rules.""While we have more than a decade's worth of experience with last-mile practices, we lack a similar depth of background in the Internet traffic exchange context,"" the commission wrote. ""Thus, we find that the best approach is to watch, learn, and act as required, but not intervene now, especially not with prescriptive rules.""Schaeffer said he's confident that the FCC will act on his company's complaints if the Internet service providers don't back down first. ""They have an affirmative obligation to deliver all of the Internet all of the time at the speeds they have sold to their customers,"" the Cogent CEO said.Level 3's Mooney argued that the FCC's order ""clearly requires that when broadband providers sell their customers access to the Internet, they have an obligation to make adequate interconnection arrangements to honor those promises.""Matt Wood, the policy director of Free Press, an advocacy group that fought for strong net neutrality regulations, said the FCC should consider the complaints based on the exact circumstances in each case. But, he said, the agency should take the issue seriously.""This could really be just a toll, almost like an entry fee,"" he said. ""It certainly sounds like a problem and one we're very concerned about.""Dan Rayburn, an industry analyst with the firm Frost & Sullivan, predicted that Cogent's complaints won't go anywhere at the FCC.""The FCC is certainly not going to take a complaint seriously when the only merit is 'we want free.' I want everything free too. We all want things for free,"" he said. ""[Cogent is] taking steps, as all companies do, to protect their bottom line. But trying to then classify it as a 'net neutrality' argument—that's just disingenuous.""""",,,

"""Netflix may have been one of net neutrality’s staunchest supporters, but the online video company said it is not concerned about the new FCC leadership's intentions to overturn the rules.Ajit Pai, a Republican, was formally named as the new FCC chairman following the recent departure of Tom Wheeler.Pai, who has advocated for a lighter touch regulatory approach, has set his key issue around finding a way to overturn the net neutrality rules.Following its recent quarterly results, Netflix said in a recent letter to shareholders (PDF) that its well established relationships with all of the major ISPs means a change in net neutrality won't likely impact their earnings or the user experience. RELATED: Netflix’s 1.93M new domestic subs in Q4 ‘not just a Comcast story,’ Hastings says“Weakening of U.S. net neutrality laws, should that occur, is unlikely to materially affect our domestic margins or service quality because we are now popular enough with consumers to keep our relationships with ISPs stable,” Netflix said.Under the FCC’s current net neutrality rules, ISPs are barred from blocking or throttling traffic from other websites or letting certain web application providers pay for priority treatment. These rules not only had benefitedStill, Netflix said that it will continue to support net neutrality as it will help foster innovation by emerging players in the online video and broader internet application space.“On a public policy basis, however, strong net neutrality is important to support innovation and smaller firms,” Netflix said. “No one wants ISPs to decide what new and potentially disruptive services can operate over their networks, or to favor one service over another. We hope the new U.S. administration and Congress will recognize that keeping the network neutral drives job growth and innovation.”One thing that Netflix may have going for it as it wades through a new regulatory regime at the FCC is its sheer size and its customer base.As of the end of 2016, Netflix had 47.9 million paid memberships in the United States and another 41.2 million outside the US.North America is Netflix’s biggest market. According to Sandvine's Internet Phenomena report, Netflix makes up nearly 35% of downstream internet traffic during peak viewing periods.Analysts said that even though Netflix may be saying they are not worried about a potential overturn in net neutrality, their customers could see issues in bandwidth allocation as they migrate to 4K quality video.“Basically, Netflix is saying they are 'too big to throttle,'"" said Joel Espelien, senior analyst for TDG Research, in an e-mail to FierceOnlineVideo. “I’m not sure that's the case, particularly as more consumers move to 4K. ISPs could still go to Netflix and say, ‘we'll carry you because you are popular, but we're not going to let you consume all the bandwidth on our network.’”Brett Sappington, senior director of research for Parks Associates, agreed.“I am not surprised that they say that they are not worried, even if they are worried,” Sappington said. “Why spread concern among investors when Netflix doesn’t yet know what the new FCC leadership will look like in the near future? Also, Netflix’s popularity provides it with notably more protection than a smaller OTT service would have.”Sappington added that if large broadband providers like AT&T or Comcast slowed down Netflix traffic, the video streaming giant would tell its customers to look elsewhere for their broadband service.“If broadband providers noticeably throttled Netflix data and produced a bad experience, you can be certain that Netflix will be quick to point out the broadband providers that are doing so, encouraging their millions of subscribers to switch to cooperative broadband companies,” Sappington said.While it is hard to gauge the effect of the new FCC, which just came into focus, another factor protecting Netflix are its interconnection agreements with large ISPs.The fights between Netflix and its internet transit providers Cogent Communications and Level 3 with the likes of CenturyLink, Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Charter/TWC were a daily news item in 2014.Netflix wanted to get free interconnection so it could deliver streaming video traffic to the ISPs’ network instead of having to work with a transit provider to carry their traffic to each last mile network. Although the FCC did not bar interconnection payments, the regulator developed a process (PDF) under the net neutrality rules that allows OTT video providers to question whether an ISP’s payment request is ""unjust"" or ""unreasonable.""At the same time, internet transit suppliers to Netflix like Level 3 and Cogent Communications have made strident progress with the interconnection agreement issue.Cogent told investors in December that it won’t see any impact on the interconnection agreements it has with its ISP partners like AT&T and Comcast if the net neutrality rules are overturned by the new administration. Under the terms of the agreements Cogent has, each interconnection partner is required to make upgrades to alleviate port congestion.  David Schaeffer, CEO of Cogent, said that “we have our agreements in place that are multiyear and their commercial agreements.”

Chapter 14: The Dynamics of Digital Work50. Working Virtually51. Collaborative Software52. BrainstormingAppendixChapter 8: Net Neutrality and the Digital DivideFrom Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutralityProponents of net neutrality include consumer advocates, human rights organizations such as Article 19,[95] online companies and some technology companies.[96] Many major Internet application companies are advocates of neutrality. Yahoo!, Vonage,[97] eBay, Amazon,[98] IAC/InterActiveCorp. Microsoft, Twitter, Tumblr, Etsy, Daily Kos, Greenpeace, along with many other companies and organizations, have also taken a stance in support of net neutrality.[99][100] Cogent Communications, an international Internet service provider, has made an announcement in favor of certain net neutrality policies.[101] In 2008, Google published a statement speaking out against letting broadband providers abuse their market power to affect access to competing applications or content. They further equated the situation to that of the telephony market, where telephone companies are not allowed to control who their customers call or what those customers are allowed to say.[4] However, Google’s support of net neutrality was called into question in 2014.[102] Several civil rights groups, such as the ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Free Press, and Fight for the Future support net neutrality.[103]Individuals who support net neutrality include World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee,[104] Vinton Cerf,[105][106] Lawrence Lessig,[107] Robert W. McChesney, Steve Wozniak, Susan P. Crawford, Marvin Ammori, Ben Scott, David Reed,[108] and U.S. President Barack Obama.[109][110] On 10 November 2014, Obama recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[111][112][113] On 12 November 2014, AT&T stopped build-out of their fiber network until it has “solid net neutrality rules to follow”.[114] On 31 January 2015, AP News reported that the FCC will present the notion of applying (“with some caveats”) Title II (common carrier) of the Communications Act of 1934 and section 706 of the Telecommunications act of 1996 [115] to the Internet in a vote expected on 26 February 2015.[116][117][118][119][120]Supporters of net neutrality want to designate cable companies as common carriers, which would require them to allow Internet service providers (ISPs) free access to cable lines, the same model used for dial-up Internet. They want to ensure that cable companies cannot screen, interrupt or filter Internet content without a court order.[121] Common carrier status would give the FCC the power to enforce net neutrality rules.[122] SaveTheInternet.com accuses cable and telecommunications companies of wanting the role of gatekeepers, being able to control which websites load quickly, load slowly, or don’t load at all. According to SaveTheInternet.com these companies want to charge content providers who require guaranteed speedy data delivery – to create advantages for their own search engines, Internet phone services, and streaming video services – and slowing access or blocking access to those of competitors.[123] Vinton Cerf, a co-inventor of the Internet Protocol and current vice president of Google argues that the Internet was designed without any authorities controlling access to new content or new services.[124] He concludes that the principles responsible for making the Internet such a success would be fundamentally undermined were broadband carriers given the ability to affect what people see and do online.[105]Cerf has also written about the importance of looking at problems like Net Neutrality through the a combination of the Internet’s layered system and the multistakeholder model that governs it.[125] He shows how challenges can arise that can implicate Net Neutrality in certain infrastructure-based cases, such as when ISPs to enter into exclusive arrangements with large building owners, leaving the residents unable to exercise any choice in broadband provider.[126]Proponents of net neutrality argue that a neutral net will foster free speech and lead to further democratic participation on the internet. Senator Al Franken from Minnesota fears that without new regulations, the major Internet Service Providers will use their position of power to stifle people’s rights. He calls net neutrality the “First Amendment issue of our time.”[127] By ensuring that all people and websites have equal access to each other, regardless of their ability to pay, proponents of net neutrality wish to prevent the need to pay for speech and the further centralization of media power. Lawrence Lessig and Robert W. McChesney argue that net neutrality ensures that the Internet remains a free and open technology, fostering democratic communication. Lessig and McChesney go on to argue that the monopolization of the Internet would stifle the diversity of independent news sources and the generation of innovative and novel web content.[107]Users with faster Internet connectivity (e.g., fiber) abandon a slow-loading video at a faster rate than users with slower Internet connectivity (e.g., cable or mobile).[128] A “fast lane” in the Internet can irrevocably decrease the user’s tolerance to the relative slowness of the “slow lane”.Proponents of net neutrality invoke the human psychological process of adaptation where when people get used to something better, they would not ever want to go back to something worse. In the context of the Internet, the proponents argue that a user who gets used to the “fast lane” on the Internet would find the “slow lane” intolerable in comparison, greatly disadvantaging any provider who is unable to pay for the “fast lane”. Video providers Netflix[129] and Vimeo[130] in their comments to FCC in favor of net neutrality use the research[128] of S.S. Krishnan and Ramesh Sitaraman that provides the first quantitative evidence of adaptation to speed among online video users. Their research studied the patience level of millions of Internet video users who waited for a slow-loading video to start playing. Users who had a faster Internet connectivity, such as fiber-to-the-home, demonstrated less patience and abandoned their videos sooner than similar users with slower Internet connectivity. The results demonstrate how users can get used to faster Internet connectivity, leading to higher expectation of Internet speed, and lower tolerance for any delay that occurs. Author Nicholas Carr[131]and other social commentators[132][133] have written about the habituation phenomenon by stating that a faster flow of information on the Internet can make people less patient.Net neutrality advocates argue that allowing cable companies the right to demand a toll to guarantee quality or premium delivery would create an exploitative business model based on the ISPs position as gatekeepers.[134] Advocates warn that by charging websites for access, network owners may be able to block competitor Web sites and services, as well as refuse access to those unable to pay.[107] According to Tim Wu, cable companies plan to reserve bandwidth for their own television services, and charge companies a toll for priority service.[135] Proponents of net neutrality argue that allowing for preferential treatment of Internet traffic, or tiered service, would put newer online companies at a disadvantage and slow innovation in online services.[96] Tim Wu argues that, without network neutrality, the Internet will undergo a transformation from a market ruled by innovation to one ruled by deal-making.[135] SaveTheInternet.com argues that net neutrality puts everyone on equal terms, which helps drive innovation. They claim it is a preservation of the way the internet has always operated, where the quality of websites and services determined whether they succeeded or failed, rather than deals with ISPs.[123] Lawrence Lessig and Robert W. McChesney argue that eliminating net neutrality would lead to the Internet resembling the world of cable TV, so that access to and distribution of content would be managed by a handful of massive, near monopolistic companies, though there are multiple service providers in each region. These companies would then control what is seen as well as how much it costs to see it. Speedy and secure Internet use for such industries as health care, finance, retailing, and gambling could be subject to large fees charged by these companies. They further explain that a majority of the great innovators in the history of the Internet started with little capital in their garages, inspired by great ideas. This was possible because the protections of net neutrality ensured limited control by owners of the networks, maximal competition in this space, and permitted innovators from outside access to the network. Internet content was guaranteed a free and highly competitive space by the existence of net neutrality.[107]Net neutrality advocates have sponsored legislation claiming that authorizing incumbent network providers to override transport and application layer separation on the Internet would signal the decline of fundamental Internet standards and international consensus authority. Further, the legislation asserts that bit-shaping the transport of application data will undermine the transport layer’s designed flexibility.[136]Alok Bhardwaj, founder of Epic Privacy Browser, argues that any violations to network neutrality, realistically speaking, will not involve genuine investment but rather payoffs for unnecessary and dubious services. He believes that it is unlikely that new investment will be made to lay special networks for particular websites to reach end-users faster. Rather, he believes that non-net neutrality will involve leveraging quality of service to extract remuneration from websites that want to avoid being slowed down.[137][138]Some advocates say network neutrality is needed in order to maintain the end-to-end principle. According to Lawrence Lessig and Robert W. McChesney, all content must be treated the same and must move at the same speed in order for net neutrality to be true. They say that it is this simple but brilliant end-to-end aspect that has allowed the Internet to act as a powerful force for economic and social good.[107] Under this principle, a neutral network is a dumb network, merely passing packets regardless of the applications they support. This point of view was expressed by David S. Isenberg in his paper, “The Rise of the Stupid Network”. He states that the vision of an intelligent network is being replaced by a new network philosophy and architecture in which the network is designed for always-on use, not intermittence and scarcity. Rather than intelligence being designed into the network itself, the intelligence would be pushed out to the end-user’s device; and the network would be designed simply to deliver bits without fancy network routing or smart number translation. The data would be in control, telling the network where it should be sent. End-user devices would then be allowed to behave flexibly, as bits would essentially be free and there would be no assumption that the data is of a single data rate or data type.[139]Contrary to this idea, the research paper titled End-to-end arguments in system design by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark[140] argues that network intelligence doesn’t relieve end systems of the requirement to check inbound data for errors and to rate-limit the sender, nor for a wholesale removal of intelligence from the network core.Opponents of net neutrality regulations include civil rights groups, economists, internet providers and technologists. Among corporations, opponents include AT&T, Verizon, IBM, Intel, Cisco, Nokia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Juniper, dLink, Wintel, Alcatel-Lucent, Corning, Panasonic, Ericsson, and others.[73][141][142] Notable technologists who oppose net neutrality include Marc Andreessen, Scott McNealy, Peter Thiel, David Farber, Nicholas Negroponte, Rajeev Suri, Jeff Pulver, John Perry Barlow, and Bob Kahn.[143][144][145][146][147][148][149][150][151][152]Nobel Prize-winning economist Gary Becker‘s paper titled, “Net Neutrality and Consumer Welfare”, published by the Journal of Competition Law & Economics, alleges that claims by net neutrality proponents “do not provide a compelling rationale for regulation” because there is “significant and growing competition” among broadband access providers.[144][153] Google Chairman Eric Schmidt states that, while Google views that similar data types should not be discriminated against, it is okay to discriminate across different data types—a position that both Google and Verizon generally agree on, according to Schmidt.[154][155] According to the Journal, when President Barack Obama announced his support for strong net neutrality rules late in 2014, Schmidt told a top White House official the president was making a mistake.[155]Several civil rights groups, such as the National Urban League, Jesse Jackson‘s Rainbow/PUSH, and League of United Latin American Citizens, also oppose Title II net neutrality regulations,[156] who said that the call to regulate broadband Internet service as a utility would harm minority communities by stifling investment in undeserved areas.[157][158]A number of other opponents created Hands Off The Internet,[159] a website created in 2006 to promote arguments against internet regulation. Principal financial support for the website came from AT&T, and members included BellSouth, Alcatel, Cingular, and Citizens Against Government Waste.[160][161][162][163][164]Robert Pepper, a senior managing director, global advanced technology policy, at Cisco Systems, and former FCC chief of policy development, says: “The supporters of net neutrality regulation believe that more rules are necessary. In their view, without greater regulation, service providers might parcel out bandwidth or services, creating a bifurcated world in which the wealthy enjoy first-class Internet access, while everyone else is left with slow connections and degraded content. That scenario, however, is a false paradigm. Such an all-or-nothing world doesn’t exist today, nor will it exist in the future. Without additional regulation, service providers are likely to continue doing what they are doing. They will continue to offer a variety of broadband service plans at a variety of price points to suit every type of consumer”.[165] Computer scientist Bob Kahn [150] has said net neutrality is a slogan that would freeze innovation in the core of the Internet.[143]Farber has written and spoken strongly in favor of continued research and development on core Internet protocols. He joined academic colleagues Michael Katz, Christopher Yoo, and Gerald Faulhaber in an op-ed for the Washington Post strongly critical of network neutrality, essentially stating that while the Internet is in need of remodeling, congressional action aimed at protecting the best parts of the current Internet could interfere with efforts to build a replacement.[166]According to a letter to key Congressional and FCC leaders sent by 60 major ISP technology suppliers including IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, and Cisco, Title II regulation of the internet “means that instead of billions of broadband investment driving other sectors of the economy forward, any reduction in this spending will stifle growth across the entire economy. This is not idle speculation or fear mongering…Title II is going to lead to a slowdown, if not a hold, in broadband build out, because if you don’t know that you can recover on your investment, you won’t make it.”[73][167][168][169] According to the Wall Street Journal, in one of Google’s few lobbying sessions with FCC officials, the company urged the agency to craft rules that encourage investment in broadband Internet networks—a position that mirrors the argument made by opponents of strong net neutrality rules, such as AT&T and Comcast.[155] Opponents of net neutrality argue that prioritization of bandwidth is necessary for future innovation on the Internet.[142] Telecommunications providers such as telephone and cable companies, and some technology companies that supply networking gear, argue telecom providers should have the ability to provide preferential treatment in the form of tiered services, for example by giving online companies willing to pay the ability to transfer their data packets faster than other Internet traffic.[170] The added revenue from such services could be used to pay for the building of increased broadband access to more consumers.[96]Opponents say that net neutrality would make it more difficult for Internet service providers (ISPs) and other network operators to recoup their investments in broadband networks.[171] John Thorne, senior vice president and deputy general counsel of Verizon, a broadband and telecommunications company, has argued that they will have no incentive to make large investments to develop advanced fibre-optic networks if they are prohibited from charging higher preferred access fees to companies that wish to take advantage of the expanded capabilities of such networks. Thorne and other ISPs have accused Google and Skype of freeloading or free riding for using a network of lines and cables the phone company spent billions of dollars to build.[142][172][173] Marc Andreessen states that “a pure net neutrality view is difficult to sustain if you also want to have continued investment in broadband networks. If you’re a large telco right now, you spend on the order of $20 billion a year on capex [capital expenditure]. You need to know how you’re going to get a return on that investment. If you have these pure net neutrality rules where you can never charge a company like Netflix anything, you’re not ever going to get a return on continued network investment — which means you’ll stop investing in the network. And I would not want to be sitting here 10 or 20 years from now with the same broadband speeds we’re getting today.”[174]Those in favor of forms of non-neutral tiered Internet access argue that the Internet is already not a level playing field: large companies achieve a performance advantage over smaller competitors by providing more and better-quality servers and buying high-bandwidth services. Should prices drop for lower levels of access, or access to only certain protocols, for instance, a change of this type would make Internet usage more neutral, with respect to the needs of those individuals and corporations specifically seeking differentiated tiers of service. Network expert[175] Richard Bennett has written, “A richly funded Web site, which delivers data faster than its competitors to the front porches of the Internet service providers, wants it delivered the rest of the way on an equal basis. This system, which Google calls broadband neutrality, actually preserves a more fundamental inequality.”[176]Proponents of net neutrality regulations say network operators have continued to under-invest in infrastructure.[177] However, according to Copenhagen Economics, US investment in telecom infrastructure is 50 percent higher that of the European Union. As a share of GDP, The US’s broadband investment rate per GDP trails only the UK and South Korea slightly, but exceeds Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France sizably.[178] On broadband speed, Akamai reported that the US trails only South Korea and Japan among its major trading partners, and trails only Japan in the G-7 in both average peak connection speed and percentage of the population connection at 10 Mbit/s or higher, but are substantially ahead of most of its other major trading partners.[178]The White House reported in June 2013 that U.S. connection speeds are “the fastest compared to other countries with either a similar population or land mass.”[179] Akamai’s report on “The State of the Internet” in the 2nd quarter of 2014 says “a total of 39 states saw 4K readiness rate more than double over the past year.” In other words, as ZDNet reports, those states saw a “major” increase in the availability of the 15Mbit/s speed needed for 4K video.[180] According to the Progressive Policy Institute and ITU data, the United States has the most affordable entry-level prices for fixed broadband in the OECD.[178][181]In Indonesia, there is a very high number of Internet connections that are subjected to exclusive deals between the ISP and the building owner, and changing this dynamic could unlock much more consumer choice and higher speeds.[126] FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai and Federal Election Commission’s Lee Goldman wrote in a Politico piece in February 2015, “Compare Europe, which has long had utility-style regulations, with the United States, which has embraced a light-touch regulatory model. Broadband speeds in the United States, both wired and wireless, are significantly faster than those in Europe. Broadband investment in the United States is several multiples that of Europe. And broadband’s reach is much wider in the United States, despite its much lower population density.” [182]A 2010 paper on net neutrality by Nobel Prize economist Gary Becker and his colleagues stated that “there is significant and growing competition among broadband access providers and that few significant competitive problems have been observed to date, suggesting that there is no compelling competitive rationale for such regulation.”[153] Becker and fellow economists Dennis Carlton and Hal Sidler found that “Between mid-2002 and mid-2008, the number of high-speed broadband access lines in the United States grew from 16 million to nearly 133 million, and the number of residential broadband lines grew from 14 million to nearly 80 million. Internet traffic roughly tripled between 2007 and 2009. At the same time, prices for broadband Internet access services have fallen sharply.”[153] The PPI reports that the profit margins of U.S. broadband providers are generally one-sixth to one-eighth of companies that use broadband (such as Apple or Google), contradicting the idea of monopolistic price-gouging by providers.[178]A report by the Progressive Policy Institute in June 2014 argues that nearly every American can choose from at least 5-6 broadband internet service providers, despite claims that there are only a ‘small number’ of broadband providers.[178] Citing research from the FCC, the Institute wrote that 90 percent of American households have access to at least one wired and one wireless broadband provider at speeds of at least 4 Mbit/s (500 kbyte/s) downstream and 1 Mbit/s (125 kbyte/s) upstream and that nearly 88 percent of Americans can choose from at least two wired providers of broadband disregarding speed (typically choosing between a cable and telco offering). Further, three of the four national wireless companies report that they offer 4G LTE to between 250-300 million Americans, with the fourth (T-Mobile) sitting at 209 million and counting.[178] Similarly, the FCC reported in June 2008 that 99.8 percent of zip codes in the United States had two or more providers of high speed Internet lines available, and 94.6 percent of zip codes had four or more providers, as reported by University of Chicago economists Gary Becker, Dennis Carlton, and Hal Sider in a 2010 paper.[153]When FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler redefined broadband from 4 Mbit/s to 25 Mbit/s (3.125 MB/s) or greater in January 2015, FCC commissioners Ajit Pai and Mike O’Reilly believed the redefinition was to set up the agency’s intent to settle the net neutrality fight with new regulations. The commissioners argued that the stricter speed guidelines painted the broadband industry as less competitive, justifying the FCC’s moves with Title II net neutrality regulations.[183]FCC commissioner Ajit Pai states that the FCC completely brushes away the concerns of smaller competitors who are going to be subject to various taxes, such as state property taxes and general receipts taxes.[184] As a result, according to Pai, that does nothing to create more competition within the market.[184] According to Pai, the FCC’s ruling to impose Title II regulations is opposed by the country’s smallest private competitors and many municipal broadband providers.[185] In his dissent, Pai noted that 142 wireless ISPs (WISPs) said that FCC’s new “regulatory intrusion into our businesses…would likely force us to raise prices, delay deployment expansion, or both.” He also noted that 24 of the country’s smallest ISPs, each with fewer than 1,000 residential broadband customers, wrote to the FCC stating that Title II “will badly strain our limited resources” because they “have no in-house attorneys and no budget line items for outside counsel.” Further, another 43 municipal broadband providers told the FCC that Title II “will trigger consequences beyond the Commission’s control and risk serious harm to our ability to fund and deploy broadband without bringing any concrete benefit for consumers or edge providers that the market is not already proving today without the aid of any additional regulation.”[141]FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, who opposed the net neutrality ruling, claims that the ruling issued by the FCC to impose Title II regulations explicitly opens the door to billions of dollars in new fees and taxes on broadband by subjecting them to the telephone-style taxes under the Universal Service Fund. Net neutrality proponent Free Press argues that, “the average potential increase in taxes and fees per household would be far less” than the estimate given by net neutrality opponents, and that if there were to be additional taxes, the tax figure may be around $4 billion. Under favorable circumstances, “the increase would be exactly zero.”[186] Meanwhile, the Progressive Policy Institute claims that Title II could trigger taxes and fees up to $11 billion a year.[187]Financial website Nerd Wallet did their own assessment and settled on a possible $6.25 billion tax impact, estimating that the average American household may see their tax bill increase $67 annually.[187]FCC spokesperson Kim Hart said that the ruling “does not raise taxes or fees. Period.”[187] However, the opposing commissioner, Ajit Pai, claims that “the plan explicitly opens the door to billions of dollars in new taxes on broadband…These new taxes will mean higher prices for consumers and more hidden fees that they have to pay.” [188] Pai explained that, “One avenue for higher bills is the new taxes and fees that will be applied to broadband. Here’s the background. If you look at your phone bill, you’ll see a ‘Universal Service Fee,’ or something like it. These fees —- what most Americans would call taxes — are paid by Americans on their telephone service. They funnel about $9 billion each year through the FCC. Consumers haven’t had to pay these taxes on their broadband bills because broadband has never before been a Title II service. But now it is. And so the Order explicitly opens the door to billions of dollars in new taxes.”[141]Since the early 1990s, Internet traffic has increased steadily. The arrival of picture-rich websites and MP3s led to a sharp increase in the mid-1990s followed by a subsequent sharp increase since 2003 as video streaming and Peer-to-peer file sharing became more common.[189][190] In reaction to companies including YouTube, as well as smaller companies starting to offer free video content, using substantial amounts of bandwidth, at least one Internet service provider (ISP), SBC Communications (now AT&T Inc.), has suggested that it should have the right to charge these companies for making their content available over the provider’s network.[191]Bret Swanson of the Wall Street Journal wrote in 2007 that the popular websites of that time, including YouTube, MySpace, and blogs, were put at risk by net neutrality. He noted that, at the time, YouTube streamed as much data in three months as the world’s radio, cable and broadcast television channels did in one year, 75 petabytes. He argued that networks were not remotely prepared to handle the amount of data required to run these sites. He also argued that net neutrality would prevent broadband networks from being built, which would limit available bandwidth and thus endanger innovation.[192] One example of these concerns was the “series of tubes” analogy, which was presented by US senator Ted Stevens during a committee hearing in the US senate in 2006.According to a Wired magazine article by TechFreedom’s Berin Szoka, Matthew Starr, and Jon Henke, local governments and public utilities impose the most significant barriers to entry for more cable broadband competition: “While popular arguments focus on supposed ‘monopolists’ such as big cable companies, it’s government that’s really to blame.” The authors state that local governments and their public utilities charge ISPs far more than they actually cost and have the final say on whether an ISP can build a network. The public officials determine what requirements an ISP must meet to get approval for access to publicly owned “rights of way” (which lets them place their wires), thus reducing the number of potential competitors who can profitably deploy Internet service—such as AT&T’s U-Verse, Google Fiber, and Verizon FiOS. Kickbacks may include municipal requirements for ISPs such as building out service where it isn’t demanded, donating equipment, and delivering free broadband to government buildings.[193]According to PayPal founder and Facebook investor Peter Thiel, “Net neutrality has not been necessary to date. I don’t see any reason why it’s suddenly become important, when the Internet has functioned quite well for the past 15 years without it…. Government attempts to regulate technology have been extraordinarily counterproductive in the past.”[144] Max Levchin, the other co-founder of PayPal, echoed similar statements, telling CNBC, “The Internet is not broken, and it got here without government regulation and probably in part because of lack of government regulation.”[194] Opponents of new federal net neutrality policies point to the success of the internet as a sign that new regulations are not necessary. They argue that the freedom which websites, ISPs and consumers have had to settle their own disputes and compete through innovation is the reason why the internet has been such a rapid success. One of Congress’s most outspoken critics of net neutrality regulations is Senator Ted Cruz from Texas, who points out that “innovation [on the internet] is happening without having to go to government and say ‘Mother, may I?’ What happens when the government starts regulating a service as a public utility is it calcifies everything and freezes it in place.”[195] In regulating how the internet is provided, opponents argue that the government will hinder innovation on the web.FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, who was one of the two commissioners who opposed the net neutrality proposal, criticized the FCC’s ruling on internet neutrality, stating that the perceived threats from ISPs to deceive consumers, degrade content, or disfavor the content that they don’t like are non-existent: “The evidence of these continuing threats? There is none; it’s all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria. A small ISP in North Carolina allegedly blocked VoIP calls a decade ago. Comcast capped BitTorrent traffic to ease upload congestion eight years ago. Apple introduced Facetime over Wi-Fi first, cellular networks later. Examples this picayune and stale aren’t enough to tell a coherent story about net neutrality. The bogeyman never had it so easy.”[141] FCC Commissioner Mike O’Reilly, the other opposing commissioner, also claims that the ruling is a solution to a hypothetical problem, “Even after enduring three weeks of spin, it is hard for me to believe that the Commission is establishing an entire Title II/net neutrality regime to protect against hypothetical harms. There is not a shred of evidence that any aspect of this structure is necessary. The D.C. Circuit called the prior, scaled-down version a ‘prophylactic’ approach. I call it guilt by imagination.”[196] In a Chicago Tribune article, FCC Commissioner Pai and Joshua Wright of the Federal Trade Commission argue that “the Internet isn’t broken, and we don’t need the president’s plan to ‘fix’ it. Quite the opposite. The Internet is an unparalleled success story. It is a free, open and thriving platform.”[74]

"""The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted yesterday to support a series of rules that we more commonly reference as “Net Neutrality.” These rules will reclassify broadband Internet access as a Title II telecommunications service, subjecting them to regulation similar to that of a utility or common carrier.The concern driving Net Neutrality has focused on consumer broadband access and networks, highlighting such notions as blocking of internet sites and throttling of traffic such as BitTorrent. However, some of the associated headlines really have nothing to do with the access part of the network. Instead, they are related to network interconnects, which are the lurking issue under much of what we call Net Neutrality.The Netflix Factor
Netflix is a poster child for and big supporter of Net Neutrality. Netflix has received a lot of press for its conflicts with Comcast and Verizon, followed by coverage of its deals with them. Some examples:These deals don’t affect how traffic is treated on the networks of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as Comcast or Verizon. In both cases, the Netflix traffic is treated “neutrally,” the same as other traffic. So what are these deals about?It’s All About Peering
Instead, these deals are about network interconnects or “peering,” and cover the instances where ISPs and backbone providers have an interface (“peering point”) to pass traffic back and forth. Here’s a description of peering from Wikipedia:In computer networking, peering is a voluntary interconnection of administratively separate Internet networks for the purpose of exchanging traffic between the users of each network. The pure definition of peering is settlement-free, “bill-and-keep,” or “sender keeps all,” meaning that neither party pays the other in association with the exchange of traffic; instead, each derives and retains revenue from its own customers.Today, network operators create peering points with each other based on mutually beneficial locations and traffic loads. Usually, these are settlement or payment free because of reasonably balanced traffic. When there is an imbalance, one party “settles” with or pays the other for access. For a detailed description of the high-level structure of the internet and how peering and settlements work, please see “Comcast vs. Netflix: Is this really about Net neutrality?”Netflix has asserted that Comcast and Verizon were throttling Netflix traffic at the peering point in an attempt to extract payment for transit. My sources at Verizon say this was not the case, and instead that the bottlenecks were due to poor network engineering on the part of Netflix and their backbone network providers. In both cases, Netflix wound up paying for a direct peering point (no intermediary provider) and possibly larger bandwidth. At the same time, Netflix continued to press for a broader definition of Net Neutrality to cover peering or interconnects.Net Neutrality Redux
Yesterday the FCC voted to adopt Open Internet rules and to reclassify broadband Internet access as a Title II telecommunications service. The FCC also voted to forbear from (omit) 27 provisions of Title II. The rules have not yet been published because “editorial privilege” (opportunity to edit after the vote) was granted. However, the rules will subject interconnections to FCC scrutiny and regulation. A preview of what the regulations may look like is found in this excerpt from a Reuters story from January 28, 2015 on “U.S. net neutrality rules expected to cover interconnection deals”:The new draft is expected to expand the authority of the FCC to previously unregulated traffic exchange deals, known as interconnection agreements, according to two sources who spoke anonymously because the plan has not been made public.“It’s the only way they can make it work with the principles that President (Barack) Obama outlined and Chairman Wheeler reaffirmed,” said David Schaeffer, chief executive of Cogent Communications Group Inc., a long-haul Internet traffic carrier that has advocated for regulation of interconnection deals
.…
[FCC officials] said the discussion was very fluid and several options were considered, including a case-by-case approach to resolving complaints, which would be more palatable to ISPs, or an outright ban on fees for interconnecting with networks, which Netflix has sought.A Quiet Expansion of Net Neutrality
The previous version of Net Neutrality was based on the FCC’s Open Internet Report and Order, which was issued in December 2010. It applied only to “mass-market” broadband internet services with access to “substantially all Internet endpoints.”With this latest vote, the FCC has substantially expanded the scope of Network Neutrality to include peering. This may extend the impact of Net Neutrality to cover non mass-market business services, such as VPN.I believe that regulation of interconnects may be the big impact of this latest round of Net Neutrality. There’s a lot more to come before we know exactly how yesterday’s ruling impacts our industry and our internet experience. Stay tuned!""",,,
"""Competitive carriers, public interest groups and Web-based companies this week laid out their arguments in federal court to support open Internet regulations that were adopted in February by the Federal Communications Commission.“The FCC Order will help preserve an Internet unfettered from interference from the gatekeeper power of the companies that provide consumers with access to it,” the companies declared in a joint brief that was filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.A diverse group, including Cogent Communications, Dish Network, and the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, argue the FCC’s Net neutrality regulations should be upheld. Joining them in the brief are Comptel, Level 3 Communications, Netflix, Public Knowledge, Union Square Ventures and Vimeo, among others.The FCC’s regulations – which prevent blocking, slowing down or paid prioritization of lawful Web traffic – took effect in June. ""Contrary to claims that the sky would fall, Open Internet protections have proven to be a free market driver,” CompTel CEO Chip Pickering said in a statement in conjunction with the filing of the Sept. 21 joint brief. “Indeed, stocks for incumbent and competitive networks and Internet companies are all maintaining and increasing in value. The rules benefit the entire Internet ecosystem and continued growth of this sector remains a catalyst for our economy. With the adoption of strong open Internet policy, the sun, sky and tech sector are still rising.”But in lawsuits filed to overturn the FCC’s Open Internet order, various telecom and cable interests – including the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) – argue the FCC lacked authority to regulate the broadband industry under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. The Title II decision, they contend, threats to burden a broadband industry that has invested well over $1 trillion since 1996.“This appeal is not about Net neutrality,” former FCC Chairman Michael Powell of NCTA said earlier this year in a statement, “but the FCC’s unnecessary action to apply outdated utility style regulation to the most innovative network in our history.""Oral arguments are scheduled in the case for Dec. 4, 2015, before the appeals court. -or-Log in with your Channel Partners accountAlternatively, post a comment by completing the form below:Your email address will not be published.

"""Netflix may have recently agreed to pay Comcast for delivering its traffic to end users, but CEO Reed Hastings is clearly not happy about it. He recently slammed the existing Net neutrality situation that has given rise to the need for Netflix to pay for interconnection, whereas in the past there have always been settlement-free peering arrangements.And as far as Net neutrality goes, Verizon earlier in the year prevailed in a lawsuit to block the Federal Communications Commission's ability to enforce Net neutrality rules. Since then, consumers have anecdotally reported slower video streaming experiences across a variety of providers. “Some big ISPs are extracting a toll because they can -- they effectively control access to millions of consumers and are willing to sacrifice the interests of their own customers to press Netflix and others to pay,” Hastings noted in a blog. “Though they have the scale and power to do this, they should realize it is in their long term interest to back strong Net neutrality. While in the short term Netflix will in cases reluctantly pay large ISPs to ensure a high quality member experience, we will continue to fight for the Internet the world needs and deserves.”He added, “Some major ISPs, like Cablevision, already practice strong net neutrality and for their broadband subscribers, the quality of Netflix and other streaming services is outstanding. But on other big ISPs, due to a lack of sufficient interconnectivity, Netflix performance has been constrained, subjecting consumers who pay a lot of money for high-speed Internet to high buffering rates, long wait times and poor video quality.”Once Netflix agrees to pay the ISP interconnection fees, however, sufficient capacity is made available and high quality service for consumers is restored.“If this kind of leverage is effective against Netflix, which is pretty large, imagine the plight of smaller services today and in the future,” he added. “Roughly the same arbitrary tax is demanded from the intermediaries such as Cogent and Level 3, who supply millions of websites with connectivity, leading to a poor consumer experience.”Netflix has always been a thorn in ISPs' sides, accounting for a majority of peak Web traffic on any given day (and 30 percent of overall Web traffic), but very little of the revenue for the pipe providers. It's also of course a competing service for pay-TV operators, most of whom are those same ISPs as well.This has given rise to a series of disputes over settlement-free peering arrangements, which Hastings was alluding to. Comcast for instance told Level 3 it would no longer exchange Internet traffic without being paid for it, back in 2010. At the time, Level 3 was a main backbone provider for Netflix, and was sending more traffic to Comcast than Comcast was sending back to Level 3 — an uneven arrangement that demanded compensation, in Comcast's view, to help pay for necessary network upgrades to accommodate all of that traffic.They two eventually resolved the dispute — terms were not disclosed — but it showcased the fundamental issue with OTT, i.e., who should ultimately pay for the infrastructure to carry it?Major ISPs like Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and Time Warner Cable have also been involved in ongoing disputes related to peering and Netflix backbone provider Cogent Communications. Last summer, Cogent accused Verizon of delaying upgrades to the ports through which the two companies exchange Internet traffic.""Cogent is not compliant with one of the basic and long-standing requirements for most settlement-free peering arrangements: that traffic between the providers be roughly in balance,"" Verizon said at the time. ""When the traffic loads are not symmetric, the provider with the heavier load typically pays the other for transit. This isn't a story about Netflix, or about Verizon 'letting' anybody's traffic deteriorate. This is a fairly boring story about a bandwidth provider that is unhappy that they are out of balance and will have to make alternative arrangements for capacity enhancements, just like any other interconnecting ISP.""Emphasizing that he is not willing to enter into paid peering arrangements, Cogent Communications CEO Dave Schaeffer last week publically offered to resolve the impasse with the ISPs over Netflix and other streaming, by paying the capital cost required for these companies to upgrade the connections (as well as Cogent's own costs) to ensure adequate capacity to deliver quality service.""Cogent believes the traditional Internet model in which each party bears its own capital costs to upgrade an interconnection should be the model for these relationships, but the reality of the gatekeeper power exercised by these telephone and cable companies requires that Cogent accept these additional costs in order to provide the highest quality Internet service possible,"" said Schaeffer.“Cogent believes that these major telephone and cable companies are attempting to leverage their monopoly on broadband residential Internet connections to increase their profits by imposing tolls on traffic requested by their customers and delivered by other Internet service providers,” the company added in a statement.Against this backdrop, Netflix has been trying to sign up providers to its own CDN, the OpenConnect project, which would minimize traffic across both backbone and access networks by caching content closer to the consumer. But it's essentially been in a stand-off with all of the major broadband providers, none of whom want to miss out on any potential revenue by forcing Netflix to pay for the privilege of quality connections.“Interestingly, there is one special case where no-fee interconnection is embraced by the big ISPs -- when they are connecting among themselves,” Hastings said. “They argue this is because roughly the same amount of data comes and goes between their networks. But when we ask them if we too would qualify for no-fee interconnect if we changed our service to upload as much data as we download-- thus filling their upstream networks and nearly doubling our total traffic -- there is an uncomfortable silence. That's because the ISP argument isn't sensible.”

2.25.15 3:30 PM EDT  By Kate Cox@kcoxdcfine by us cogent google google fiber firstlight fiber comptel lsn lightspeed networks title ii net neutrality fcc investment thirty helens agree(Rob Bruce)With only hours remaining in the countdown to tomorrow’s net neutrality vote, everyone from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill is getting their last words in. At a tech policy event in Washington, DC yesterday, a panel of ISP executives spoke about the future of competition, innovation, and network deployment as the regulations and the marketplace change around them. And when the moderator directly asked the speakers if Title II regulation would diminish investment in their networks, the answer was the same all around: nope. (Rob Bruce)There were four participants on the panel: Milo Medin, the Google VP who heads up Google Fiber; Dave Schaeffer, the CEO of Cogent; Kurt Van Wagenen, the president and CEO of FirstLight Fiber, a regional provider in the northeast; and Michael Weidman, the president and CEO of LSN, formerly known as LightSpeed Networks, a regional provider in Oregon and Washington.All four of the executives agreed that they are already busily planning for and investing in the future of their companies, and that reclassification won’t change that. However, the three retail ISP executives (Cogent works a little differently) did explain that the future isn’t all necessarily sunshine and roses.Medin pointed to the difficulties that already exist for rolling out Google Fiber in more markets. “I think cities don’t understand the amount of power they have, to make things either easier or harder,” he explained. Title II regulation, which Google has not officially made a statement in favor of (or against), would allow Google different kinds of access to utility poles and related infrastructure, which could make their future Fiber deployments a little easier.Weidman was the least enthusiastic about the FCC’s planned move. He expressed concern that “300 pages of regulation” could include harmful or overly restrictive measures that would make it harder for small companies like LSN to continue growing in the rural areas they serve.Schaeffer, however, is the one who extrapolated the most on the theme. “The internet is the first platform that’s application agnostic,” he explained. The development of the technology did what regulation didn’t and couldn’t do: created more competition in many arenas.But to distribute that access evenly, and not just where you can make a bundle of money on it, he mused, that takes a different kind of regulation: something that mandates expansion where it’s not cost-effective, and offsets those costs somehow. Describing the ideal situation, Schaeffer concluded, “At the end of the day, what I’ve described is a regulated utility,” not unlike the expansion of the electric grid. And while it’s politically impossible to make that happen, he added, “if you want private capital to be deployed to build a ubiquitous fiber network … that’s what it takes.”Google, Cogent, LSN, and FirstLight all join Sprint, T-Mobile, and Cablevision in intentionally saying that Title II reclassification won’t hurt their businesses. Other companies have also grudgingly or accidentally admitted the same, even while threatening legal action against the FCC.The FCC will finally make a decision on the matter tomorrow morning.Correction: an earlier version of this article mistakenly attributed David Schaeffer’s quote to Kurt Van Wagenen.

"""INCOMPAS Welcomes House Net Neutrality Legislation

WASHINGTON, D.C. (March 6, 2019) – Today Democratic Congressional leaders introduced net neutrality legislation that would reinstate strong open internet protections eliminated by the FCC.

In response, Chip Pickering, CEO of INCOMPAS, released the following statement:

“Strong net neutrality made the streaming revolution possible and creates jobs and competition for main street American businesses. We welcome and support the open internet legislation introduced by Democratic congressional leaders today and hope that it will attract bipartisan support.

“INCOMPAS has consistently said we would only support strong net neutrality legislation that includes the four corners of open internet protections – no blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization and strong interconnection. Last year we endorsed a Republican sponsored net neutrality bill covering these protections, and encourage both sides of the aisle to work together on a future focused solution.

“We would also note that this legislative proposal mirrors the language of the Congressional Review Act which was passed last year by a Republican controlled Senate with impressive bipartisan support. Over 80 percent of American’s support strong net neutrality protections that make starting a business easier and more affordable.”

CHANNEL: Customer Experience

Kate Cox says she ""make words about tech, politics, government, regulation, consumer stuff, video games, and lots of other things, mostly for Consumerist, a site owned by Consumer Reports.Consumerist offers consumer tips, like how to return products and how to confound a telemarketer, and covers shopper complaints, like excessive retail markups. And in recent weeks, it's also become one of my favorite sources of information on Net Neutrality, thanks to Cox.
Cox, a journalist based in Washington, D.C., writes about money, politics, regulation and consumer issues, with a particular focus on technology and the Internet.Cox earned a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and a master's in film from Boston University. She began her career at Discovery Communications before landing her first full-time writing gig at Kotaku, a news and opinion site about games and “things serious gamers care about.”After Kotaku, she worked in communications at Arlington Partnership for Affordable Housing in Arlington, Va. before landing her current position at Consumerist. I caught up with Cox last week, after the Federal Communications Commission reclassified broadband Internet.The FCC wants to adopt a new set of rules designed to give regulators greater authority in mandating how broadband Internet services are classified and delivered by service providers.The  FCC thinks regulators should view broadband Internet service providers as telecommunications services rather than information services, as the law presently defines them.That change in classification would, at least theoretically, permit the FCC to enforce mandates on how ISPs deliver broadband Internet service to their customers, as well as what measures ISPs will not be allowed to take to manage that service.Sobel: Give us a quick recap of your journey from a history major at UMass through your work at Discovery and now Consumerist.Cox: My career path has mainly been one of happy, well-timed accidents. Discovery happened to have a suitable role open when I was looking to move to DC for personal reasons, and so I ended up there. It was a great company, and I had a fantastic manager. I’m thankful for everything I learned – about the industry, and about work in general -- in my years there.But during the same time, I was also working as a freelance writer, covering video games. And when an offer came out of the blue in 2012 for me to take the chance and switch to writing full-time, I couldn’t resist. In the world of video game coverage, those positions are basically unicorns.Games are both a tech experience and a consumer product. So that, along with my journalism background and the other work in nonprofits, made joining Consumerist a no-brainer. Writing has always been my passion and I’m glad to have landed where I am.Sobel: Why is it so important for consumers of all kinds, including business professionals, to understand net neutrality and the recent FCC decision?Cox: Well, do you use the Internet? Then it affects you. And of course, now everyone uses the Internet — It’s the major engine of commerce and creativity in the 21st century.If you want to watch anything, if you want to apply for a job anywhere, if you want to research where to find a service or a specialist, then you need online access. It permeates every aspect of life and society.What the FCC’s reclassification order does is make sure that everyone can keep accessing the content they want to online, just as they have done for years. It means that the country’s (or world’s) biggest companies don’t get an unfair edge over smaller businesses and individuals, and that’s something that affects every one of us. It’s huge.Sobel: A few days ago, before the FCC decision, you wrote a piece that referenced a panel that featured Milo Medin, the Google VP who heads up Google Fiber, Dave Schaeffer, the CEO of Cogent, Kurt Van Wagenen, the president and CEO of FirstLight Fiber, a regional provider in the northeast, and Michael Weidman, the president and CEO of LSN, formerly known as LightSpeed Networks, a regional provider in Oregon and Washington.You noted: “All four of the executives agreed that they are already busily planning for and investing in the future of their companies, and that reclassification won’t change that. However, the three retail ISP executives (Cogent works a little differently) did explain that the future isn’t all necessarily sunshine and roses.” Can you elaborate?Cox: Basically, their concerns were that networks are really complicated, dynamic things, which they are. So executives whose job it is to keep expanding hundreds and thousands of miles of fiber and cable, and to make sure they keep up with customer needs as well as local, state and federal regulation are concerned about making sure there are no conflicts in those regulations, and that deployment gets easier (and cheaper) for them and not harder (and more expensive).So especially without the details of the regulation in front of them to look at, some of the leaders were concerned about very granular, concrete measures like equal access to utility poles or right-of-way for utility sheds, or the costs of dealing with authorities to get cable laid out.This is stuff that the end consumer doesn’t usually think about, but that has to keep being agreed upon over and over in order to get a network anywhere.Sobel: In another story you noted, “With the FCC set at long last to vote on strong net neutrality ... everyone is getting their last digs in. While many tech companies have previously spoken out on the issue, both for and against, the big social networks have been slow to plant their flags. That changed today, when Twitter came out swinging, cheering on the FCC’s plan.” Can you explain?Cox: The big social sites kind of are the Internet, to a lot of users. Facebook is the elephant in the room whenever you talk about tech policy or the Internet, because it is driving so much of, well, everything right now. Its reach is astonishingly broad and deep, so when Facebook takes a strong position for or against something, you notice. And when they don’t, you notice that, too.Facebook and Twitter had both been relatively quiet on the net neutrality front for a long time, even while other social sites like Tumblr were jumping into the fray. So to have Twitter unambiguously endorse one side marked a shift – not so much in the nature of the conversation, but in who was admitting the conversation was even going on.Sobel: Let's step aside from net neutrality and touch on your interest in gaming. What are your thoughts about marketers incorporating games into their strategies?Cox: Everyone’s gaming, right? On their phones, at the very least — and often on a PC, Xbox or PlayStation at home. It’s mainstream. Two indie games just got a shout out in House of Cards, of all things.We have generations who have grown up with it, to whom games are every inch as normal as television. So thinking of it as an exotic thing or something for a niche, narrow audience is the wrong way to go.And while I’m at it, any marketers thinking about using games should remember that girls and women represent about half the players.Sobel: In looking at things like gaming, branding, marketing, media and advertising, it appears net neutrality will have an impact, no matter which way it ends up. What are your suggestions for our readers and how they should be thinking about this issue moving forward?Cox: Washington thrives on partisan divides and the engine of disagreement, so there are no surprises there. But the good news is, the rest of us don’t have to act like Washington.So I would encourage everyone to think about how big a role the Internet really plays in their lives, at home and at work. If you work for a company with ten people in it – or if you’re self-employed – you need the ability to move your files and videos and content around just as well as a company the size of Comcast or Google does. And you’ve always been able to, so far, right? That’s how little businesses become big businesses.And it always has been, even before there was an Internet. The post office has to deliver ever letter with a stamp on it, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s your electric bill or a birthday card from your grandmother or a document from a lawyer.The interstate works equally well (or poorly) for someone in a 20-year-old jalopy or for a Senator in a Mercedes. When I’m at home and I request Netflix or Google or CMSwire from my browser, I should get them all equally well. And that’s the part that pretty much everyone agrees on.Sobel: Any final thoughts?Cox: Tech and data issues are becoming a bigger part of consumer news every day. When all our stuff and all our connections are digital, the rules that those systems have to work within becomes extremely important.

"""People, policy and new perspectives. That’s what makes the INCOMPAS Policy Summit the premier event for the tech conversations that are driving the future.From the Newseum stage in Washington, D.C., this year’s speakers did not disappoint. With topics ranging from broadband deployment and open internet, to 5G and the Internet of Things, it’s clear that competition remains the primary force behind the streaming revolution and the deployment of new networks.Putting policies that foster innovation and creativity in place is the key to unleashing investment and innovation, creating jobs, and lowering prices for consumers. Here are some highlights from the day:Bipartisan SolutionsContinuing the long tradition of bipartisan ideas and solutions that have made American technology and networks the envy of the world, INCOMPAS began the morning with keynote remarks from several Members of Congress.Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D-CA) opened up the morning with a passionate call to remove barriers to broadband deployment. She has co-sponsored the Dig Once and Climb Once Acts in Congress, aimed at streamlining the process for deploying new networks and infrastructure. She also expressed her support for including broadband in any infrastructure bill considered by Congress.Next up was the dynamic bipartisan duo of Congressmen Bob Latta (R-OH) and Peter Welch (D-VT) — two men fighting to bring broadband to rural America and close the digital divide. Stressing the need to bring broadband to “unserved” areas, they warned that small businesses on Main Street are at risk of being cut-off from the future without high-speed networks. Precision farming is also dependent on connectivity, which is why the agriculture sector needs to get active on deployment issues.Open Internet: Will Congress Act?Congressman Mike Coffman (R-CO) gave one of the most rousing and news-making keynotes of the day. The Republican had previously, upon speaking with his constituents in Colorado, called on the FCC to stand down on their ill-fated vote to repeal net neutrality protections. At the Summit, Rep. Coffman announced he will be introducing legislation to cement bipartisan net neutrality protections of no blocking, no throttling and no paid prioritization into law. During his remarks, Rep. Coffman declared, “The Internet should be a place where all can participate — free from unnecessary barriers. In fact, the founding principle of the internet holds that those who provide the on-ramps to the Internet, should not control what happens on the Internet.”Congressman Coffman is on the right track. INCOMPAS conducted a poll and found an incredible 80 percent of Americans — Republican, Democrat, and Trump voters — support strong open internet principles. A majority of voters said the internet has improved since 2015, and consumers are reaping the benefits of streaming, cloud computing, lower prices, and more competitive choices.The incredible backlash to the FCC repeal vote is loudest from Main Street and young Americans eager to start a new business. Actions by the National Association of Realtors, Burger King and Sonos indicate that Main Street is ready for this fight, which explains the momentum behind the Congressional Review Act vote in the Senate, the new possibility of a Republican-led effort to save net neutrality in the House, and actions by States to fill the gap.What About the Courts?Breaking down the court challenges to the FCC order, Markham Erickson, a Partner at Steptoe & Johnson and INCOMPAS’ outside counsel, discussed the legal road ahead for net neutrality. Erickson was optimistic, explaining that the Courts have a long history of supporting net neutrality under the Communications Act. INCOMPAS filed the most detailed and substantive legal filings in the FCC docket last year and will continue to lead the charge.Building the Networks of the FutureThe lack of broadband competition in America is a national disappointment: 89% of Americans only have one or two choices of broadband provider. It is a major problem that is slowing down our economy and holding back the future of applications and software — technology that will change the world.  But it was refreshing to hear success stories from companies mounting a challenge to incumbents. Moderated by Andrew Lipman, Partner at Morgan Lewis, our Building the Future panel included John Burchett, Head of Public Policy, Google Access & Google Fiber, who discussed how a refocused and refreshed Google Fiber is changing the marketplace. Burchett noted that when Google Fiber entered a new market — usually as the 3rd provider — incumbent providers like AT&T and Comcast upgrade their networks to compete with Google Fiber’s gigabit service. Plus, broadband prices for consumers drop. In fact, in Atlanta, GA, incumbents dropped their prices by $25 just from a Google Fiber deployment announcement! That’s a clear sign that monopoly markets are broken, and competition provides the cure.Microsoft’s Paula Boyd who is Senior Director, Government & Regulatory Affairs spoke about the innovative use of white spaces and spectrum, as Microsoft’s groundbreaking rural initiative to deliver broadband in hard-to-reach rural areas enters year two.Windstream’s VP of Government Affairs, Malena Barzilai, and Fatbeam’s CEO, Greg Green, stressed the need to remove regulatory barriers and local red tape that are holding back new deployment. Uniti Fiber’s VP and Deputy General Counsel of Governmental Affairs, Jeff Strenkowski, thanked FCC Chairman Ajit Pai for leading the conversation to help streamline the state and local permitting processes. The panelists were hopeful that recommendations from the BDAC process will result in action.On the question of new federal funding for broadband infrastructure, panelists warned that federal funding must not only be reserved for incumbent providers. In order to spur innovation and investment, competition must have the same opportunity to drive new deployments. Historically, smaller companies take more risks and invest in next generation technology.The Consumer CommissionerCompetition and consumers have no better champion than FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn. She’s a fighter filled with grace, substance and passion who has earned the title of the “Consumer Commissioner.”In her keynote address, Clyburn called out the FCC’s outrageous turn on business data services, describing the move to classify markets with only one broadband provider competitive as shameful and dangerous.But she did find two “bright spots” in the FCC’s agenda: a One Touch, Make Ready policy for pole attachments, as well as bringing broadband competition to consumers living in apartments, condos and low income housing. INCOMPAS shares her optimism that these are two areas the FCC can continue to make progress on in a bipartisan manner.The Streaming RevolutionThe result of strong open internet policies are clear. We are living in a streaming revolution, where consumers and creators are reaping unprecedented benefits. Consumers are cutting the cord in record numbers — 22 million adults did so last year alone, saving hundreds of dollars a month on cable. Plus, new streaming companies invested $15 billion in creative content in 2017.On our Streaming Revolution panel moderated by Dave Kumar, Partner at Goldberg, Godles, Wiener & Wright, our experts included David Morken, CEO and Chairman of Bandwidth; Monica Desai, Director of Global Public Policy at Facebook; Ivelin Ivanov, CEO and Co-Founder of Telestax; and Colin Crowell, VP of Global Public Policy & Philanthropy at Twitter. They spoke about the opportunity streaming video can bring to communities around the globe if we allow an open internet to flourish.Crowell and Desai discussed how the ability to stream from your phone — anywhere in the world — is empowering people to bear witness to history is ways consumers never imagined. Crowell said Twitter’s media features and streaming video are giving voice and rebirth to localism, especially for journalists, who use these tools to help tell more stories all over the world. Even with numerous sports channels on cable, consumers are looking to live streaming services to bring local and specific sports they love, from lacrosse and high school football, to Olympic qualifying events.Morken and Ivanov discussed how over-the-top services are transforming how enterprises conduct business, including how they connect to current and potential customers.Rocket Fiber: The Network Revitalizing DetroitRocket Fiber’s Co-Founder and CEO, Marc Hudson, gave a forthright, honest and truly inspirational keynote.At the heart of the comeback story in Detroit is Rocket Fiber. In a city where 60 percent of residents didn’t have access to fixed broadband, Rocket Fiber came to town and built a state of the art fiber network and now delivers Gigabit speeds for less than $75 dollars. The network has been an important part of the revitalization effort, bringing businesses back to downtown.Last year, Recode named Rocket Fiber the 3rd fastest network in America, edged out only by two of Google Fiber’s networks. This year, Rocket Fiber’s CEO, Marc, pledged that they’re going for number one.Internet of ThingsSheba Chacko, Chief Regulatory Counsel of BT in the Americas; Holly Borgmann Head of Government Affairs of ADT; and Melissa Glidden Tye, Vice President, Public Policy of Verizon showed us how the Internet of Things is revolutionizing our day-to-day lives.Moderated by Alexi Maltas, Partner at Hogan Lovells, our panelists talked about how smart agriculture allows farmers to live monitor their livestock’s health, and how consumers can now arm their home security systems with their smartphones from anywhere in the world. Companies like Verizon are working to deploy the 5G networks that will fuel our connected lives. We are just beginning to scratch the surface, and the potential for the Internet of Things devices and applications will change the way we work and live. This all-star panel was packed with bright and optimistic possibilities for the future.Business Strategy in the Technological AgeWe closed the day with a panel of our C-level leaders from technology companies. Moderated by John Heitmann, Partner at Kelley Drye, these expert panelists discussed their business strategies for success.Tim Koxlien, CEO of TeleQuality, spoke of the transformative impact broadband has on rural hospitals and the ability of doctors to provide remote care — stating, “the promise of telemedicine can revolutionize rural healthcare.”TeleQuality recently merged with Education Networks of America and said the strategy of connecting schools and other anchor institutions to fiber could be central to meeting our nation’s infrastructure goals.If you are a retail business customer of Granite Telecom, then you have reason to be excited by CIO Chris Chapin’s plans for the future. Granite Telecom, currently serves over 85 of the Fortune 100 companies, and it sees tremendous opportunity and utility in 5G growth for current and potential customers.James Capuano, Executive Vice President & Chief Operations Officer of First Light Fiber, explained that as his company works to scale and grow, they are focused on removing barriers to deployment. He pointed to current legislation like the Dig Once and Climb Once Acts as great first steps and urged Congress to move on those policies.A New Day for Competition:From start to finish at this year’s INCOMPAS Policy Summit, one thing was clear: Competition unites us.

In 1994, I was actually able to buy a connection at last and instead of consulting and helping people set up networks, I realized I could operate a network and servers as a business.  And that was the genesis right there.TR:  How did that that idea evolve into the global backbone you run today?ML: In 1995-1996 we started running BGP and connected to MAE-West and PAIX Palo Alto, and then we expanded to MAE-East in Virginia and to the AADS exchange in Chicago with Ameritech.  Basically, we expanded the network organically, city by city, as each case could be made to get to a place with a large density of networks.  We would look at places where there were a lot of metro fiber providers and regional carriers in a particular building and go there and make it so they can bring customers there to our core routers to get IP transit.  And that's the repeat story all around the world for our strategy; we end up facilitating a lot of local loop revenue and circuit revenue for carriers in the region, as they sell last mile or sometimes longer circuits to get to us.TR: What parts of the world are you expanding into, and how do you make the business case to expand into a new market?ML: We just brought up Rome recently, and also Osaka earlier in the year.  We're in the process of bringing up Seoul right now.  It’s not just about cities, it's about very carefully analyzing the market and noting there's a lot of stranded fiber assets out there.  It does nobody any good in the industry when you have different fiber providers whose nodes are in separate buildings in a city and there are no overlapping, common meet points.  It's much better when there are a couple carrier-neutral data centers where the people who spent the gigantic amount of capital it takes to put metro or longhaul fiber in the ground can overlap some.  And that creates an opportunity for Hurricane Electric to sell IP transit and opportunity for those facilities based carriers to realize more of the potential of their cable plant.TR: Despite all the consolidation of the last 15 years, Hurricane Electric has charted a path almost exclusively of organic growth.  Why is that?ML: There have been two problems for us with acquisitions.  First, when we were organically growing the revenue didn't support acquisitions and would have had to sell equity.  And second, we've been through two big downturns in this industry with the dot-com bomb and the financial crisis of 2008-2009.  We got through them fine, but afterwards a lot of people would look at network assets but would like the data center business much better.  To raise money from them, we would have effectively had to give the business to them.  Hurricane is closely held, and I'm not interested in taking equity money from somebody who expects an exit strategy or liquidity event.  I don't see that as a short term thing I can provide.TR: Do you see more opportunities ahead for M&A than in the past?ML: Yes, our run rate is now to the point where we can consider acquisitions on a case-by-case basis provided that they contribute revenue and more specifically margin so that it is sustainable.  Now that we're larger the conversations are going better.  We have nice enough financials that the banks that are working with us are happy, so for acquisitions we'd probably use cash or some kind of debt.TR: What type of assets would you be most interested in looking at, IP network assets or more data centers to complement the two you have in Fremont?ML: IP networks probably.  The issue for us is that on the data center side a lot of the people who have data centers primarily have equipment with a short term lease in someone else's property.  For Hurricane that's not that strong because the strength of that business is determined by what rate they end up renegotiating in 5 or 10 years.  On the data center side, we'd want to acquire the building.  It doesn't need to be wholly owned, but I need to have enough of an interest in the building such that I receive some of the benefit from making it a decent place to do business and build critical mass.TR: Hurricane Electric has been at the forefront of the migration of IPv6.  We hear less about that in the media than we did a couple years ago, why is that and how is IPv6 traffic growing?ML: Talking about IPv6 growth is like talking about continental plates moving.  It's a long term trend.  It's going to go on for the whole time a person has a working career in telecom.    But it's growing fantastically.  Take a look at Google's IPv6 statistics graph; it the beginning of 2013, it was at about 1%.  Now across its web properties Google's traffic is speaking IPv6 at a rate of about 7%.  From an industry point of view, this is fantastic.TR: What factors made you decide to go all-in with IPv6 so early in the process?ML: We deployed IPv6 early as a differentiating strategy because in telecom and especially IP, there aren't too many differentiators.  IPv6 is a new technology, the cost was relatively modest, and it actually serves an important technical purpose.  IPv6 is just awesome for us.  We had the advantage of already being an IPv4 network that was competing in interconnecting with other networks.  We applied the same aggressive strategy for expansion, but almost nobody else showed up at the game with a major network and we ended up getting about 20 free laps around the track.  For IPv6, Hurricane has 2601 adjacencies, far more than even the next couple of networks.  And that's just by us doing our normal business handling IPv6 just as we have IPv4.TR:  IP Transit is a very competitive market, have you ever considered expanding into other layers of the network with other products like CDN or hosting?ML: There's a combination of doing what you're good at and a bit obsession. You could just as well ask the question ""Why aren't you IBM?""   There are all kinds of businesses like hosting, CDN, and dedicated servers, that we could try, but it comes down to positioning and branding. Some businesses work well with your brand and some are a shift, and it's a matter of what you're effective at.  There's some mutual exclusion from both a branding and an expertise point of view.  The advantage of being good at a particular thing is that you can get really good traction at it.  But the curse is simply that you're not doing other things.The challenge for most businesses is selling, and the method by which you sell is key.  For example, the CDN business has a different target customer profile and a different method by which you sell than IP transit or colocation.  The top 20 customers of the CDN business are the ones that make you or break you.  That's very different than Hurricane's business, which targets the 50,000 or so networks in the world and a couple hundred thousand internet companies.  Hurricane is very much an engineering company.  Are we good at bolting servers into racks?  Yes, but the missing expertise for CDN is the sales side of it.TR: What makes IP transit such a competitive business, and how do you manage organic growth doing it?ML:  One of the interesting things about IP transit is that it is one of the ultimate commodities.  Normal commodities might matter where they are delivered, but some customers like hosting companies don't even care about that.  Another interesting thing about IP transit is that the price per unit declines constantly -- when I started, the price for bandwidth was $2,000/Mbps.  You can do a lot of analysis as to why, but it's essentially related to Moore's Law.  The interface speeds available on routers and telecommunications equipment are related to the speed of computers at any particular time.  Your unit price is going down, so you have to sell more and bigger ports to the same customers.  To grow we have to both grow our relationships with existing customers perpetually and expand our network footprint to reach new pools of customers, and we're making good progress on both.  Hurricane currently has over 14,000 BGP sessions with over 3700 different networks across North America, Europe, and Asia.  With the NAMEX exchange in Rome coming online soon, we'll be the first internet backbone in the world to connect to over 100 internet exchanges.TR: The FCC’s new network neutrality rules allow it to possibly intervene in peering and interconnection disputes.  Do you see that affecting your business?ML: For Hurricane, no, because we don't get in fights with people.  For net neutrality as a whole, it will probably good or neutral for us.  We're different than most networks in that we'll publicly peer with most any network in a region.  There are big fights of course, and when they happen the issue is strategically whether the damage that they do and the costs that they incur in reputation management is in excess of the amount of money actually at stake.  If they just made the network work better and resolved their interconnection disputes in private instead, it probably would have made their customers happier.TR: How do you think the world of interconnection and peering got to this point?ML: There is a tug of war on the internet between content and eyeballs, and that's always been the case.  The problem is that there are tensions from a business plans perspective that are the normal thing that companies that have to work out, and a problematic public policy thing when people act to restrict access.  These have gotten blended together in a way that, even if you're in the industry, deciphering it is extremely complicated.  But to some degree what you are seeing is also the manifestation of corporate personalities.  Different companies have different personalities, and the vast majority work through their relationships fine in the interest of the public and the industry.  But there are always a few companies that like to act out on the public stage to achieve their business objectives.TR: Thank you for talking with Telecom Ramblings!

"""25PK Buddy50Internet Patron100Internet DefenderCopyright owners have often used the DMCA’s notice and take down procedure to silence criticism instead of preventing copyright infringement. A recent DMCA take down involving the group Yes Men is yet another example of this phenomenon. On October 22, a website created by the Yes Men which parodied the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s stance on a climate change bill was taken down pursuant to a DMCA notice.The Yes Men is a group that exposes corporate greed by posing as corporate representatives and pulling off the “world’s most outrageous pranks.” Their most recent prank that caused the ire of the Chamber involved the Kerry-Boxer climate change bill. The Chamber opposes the bill even though its decision to do so has been controversial. Several members have resigned from the Chamber in opposition to its position. To criticize the Chamber’s position on the bill, the Yes Men, created a website parodying the U.S. Chamber’s website. They borrowed the Chamber’s logo and the logos of a few Chamber members. The home page of the parody website contains a letter explaining the importance of strong climate change legislation, explaining that the Chamber’s shortsighted opposition to reform may hurt it in the long term, and endorsing the Kerry-Boxer bill. The rest of the pages appear to be similar to the Chamber’s website. Reacting to the Yes Men website, the Chamber sent a DMCA notice to Hurricane Electric, the ISP that provides hosting service to May First/People Link, which in turn provides hosting services to the Yes Men parody website. The letter alleged that the Yes Men’s website infringed the Chamber’s copyright in its website. In response, Hurricane Electric took down not only the content on the Yes Men’s parody website but also cut off service to the Yes Men and websites of 400 other organizations that got their Internet service from May First/People Link.This episode raises several questions with respect to the DMCA’s design and its effect on free speech. But more fundamentally, it shows how overzealous enforcement of the DMCA can harm free speech. While, one can argue about whether or not the Yes Men website was a parody protected by fair use, there is no doubt that the 400 websites whose service was terminated had nothing to do with allegations of copyright infringement. Yet, Hurricane Electric terminated their service based on one allegation that one site was infringing copyright. The take down of the website actually accused of infringement, the Yes Men website, raises question about whether the DMCA requires content to be taken down based on a mere allegation of infringement no matter how unjustified? Does the DMCA call for cutting off Yes Men’s access to the hosting service based on one allegation of infringement? And what remedy does it afford against unjust termination?The first question seems harder to answer. At least one federal district court has rejected the argument that notice senders are under no obligation to check if a use is a fair use before sending a notice of infringement. Here the Chamber should have checked if the site was a fair use. But then it seems to have sent the notice expressly to shut down criticism – a fair use. The ISP receives a safe harbor from liability for copyright infringement by taking down content based on an allegation of infringement. This scheme encourages ISPs to take down content, even where the content may be clearly noninfringing.As for shutting down service to the Yes Men site, copyright law requires ISPs to maintain a policy of terminating the account of repeat infringers under “appropriate circumstances.” Courts have held that a mere notice of infringement does not constitute evidence of infringement. The copyright owner must present evidence to the ISP to show that a user is engaged in blatant acts of repeat infringement. Thus, Hurricane Electric’s termination of the Yes Men’s service based on one allegation of infringement is clearly not justified under the DMCA.So, what is a user to do when faced with a reckless and unjust termination? The Yes Men’s parody website was relocated by May First/People Link, the website’s upstream ISP. But what about users who are not so lucky? While the DMCA does not require termination based on one allegation of infringement, it does not provide a remedy to the user whose access/service has been terminated. The terms of service of ISPs, including Hurricane Electric, further ensure that users have very few options. The relevant portion of Hurricane Electric’s terms of service is below: Hurricane Electric may, in its sole discretion, remove or terminate the account containing, on a temporary or permanent basis, materials which Hurricane Electric believes are illegal or may create, constitute, or contribute to copyright or trademark infringements. Account holder expressly waives the right to assert any claims against Hurricane Electric for any such removal or termination.The DMCA provides incentives for takedowns and rewards ISPs with safe harbors. As a condition for these safe harbors, it requires a policy of terminating the service of repeat infringers. While not requiring terminations based on one allegation of infringement, it does nothing for those whose access is unjustly terminated. While, the DMCA safe harbors have played a vital role in development of the Internet, their design is imbalanced and extracts a heavy price on free speech. Until the law is amended to correct these imbalances, we will continue to see powerful interest silence criticism in the name of protecting copyright.

"""Recent FBI reports of a dozen physical attacks on the Internet backbone near Sacramento, CA highlight the sad state of physical cyber security and policies to cope with threats to the Internet. Sacramento is an intermediary in the Internet backbone carrying east-west traffic; it connects Chicago and San Francisco hubs, and ultimately links the West Coast with the remainder of the U.S. and Europe. No wonder the bad guys physically cut the fiber optic cable near Sacramento—it is a critical link in the most highly traveled cables in the U.S.A popular misconception is the physical Internet is among the most resilient infrastructures in modern society. After all, it was designed in the 1960s to withstand a nuclear attack. This claim is based on the mistaken belief that the physical Internet contains many alternate routes. When a break on one route is sensed, information is simply re-routed through a redundant alternate path. Unfortunately, this is no longer true in general.Over the past 20 years—since the Telecommunications Act of 1996—the physical resiliency of the Internet has slowly eroded because of bad policy and cost‐benefit economics. The 1996 Act requires Internet service providers (ISPs) to peer-share each other’s networks. While intended to encourage competition, the unintended consequence is a dramatic increase in vulnerability. In fact, more than 10 years ago NSTAC (National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee) declared the peering facilities—called “carrier hotels”—the number one vulnerability of the communications infrastructure: “The current environment, characterized by the consolidation, concentration, and collocation of telecommunications assets, is the result of regulatory obligations, business imperatives, and technology changes” [1].Carrier hotels are a dangerous consequence of regulation, with potentially national impact if one or more should fail: “…Loss of specific telecommunications nodes can cause disruption to national missions under certain circumstances” [1].Second, economics plays a major role in weakening the Internet. As the Internet becomes increasingly commercialized and regulated, it also becomes increasingly efficient and cost-effective. ISPs like AT&T, Level 3, Verizon, Hurricane Electric, Comcast, and Time Warner eliminate redundancy in the name of efficiency and profitability. What is wrong with efficiency? Efficiency translates into lower redundancy. Lower redundancy means more risk. And more risk means more vulnerability to hacks, outages, and exploits.For the past decade, ISPs have been putting more eggs into fewer baskets—fewer ISPs and fewer cables carry the global load. Even if ISPs don’t reduce the number of paths available in the physical cabling of the Internet, hidden blocking nodes are very difficult to discover without massive computational resources. Blocking nodes are nodes that segment the Internet into disjoint islands, if removed. They are the most critical of all autonomous systems [2].Figure 1 illustrates the presence of blocking nodes in the 100 most-connected AS-level ISPs of the 2004 Internet [3]. It is impossible to determine if a node is a blocking node simply by looking at Figure 1. Instead, a very time-consuming algorithm is required to determine if a node is a blocking node. The full AS13579, 37448 Internet containing 13,579 autonomous systems (nodes) and 37,448 peering relations (links) contain 2,006 blocking nodes—a result that takes hours of computation to determine. The presence of blocking nodes means the Internet can be severed into disconnected pieces by removing a single node. For the AS13579, 37448 network, this means removal of any one of 2,006 AS nodes can segment the Internet into disjointed and non-communicating sub-networks.Figure 1 also illustrates the effect of the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing algorithm on the topology and structure of the physical Internet. Randomly selecting source and destination nodes in Figure 1 and counting the number of packets traveling along the shortest path between source and destination produces a distribution as shown in Figure 1. Only a very small subset of routes is selected by OSPF, because they are the most efficient paths between randomly selected nodes. Figure 1b shows the reduction of links increases path length, making the OSPF policy behave even worse. Conversely, increasing the number of links reduces the number of hops along the shortest paths, but still overloads a few links. Topology is to blame.Now, add the efficiency required of expensive backbone networks to the model. Rather than increase number of links, Tier-1 ISPs increase the bandwidth (or number of cables) of fewer links. This creates a self-organizing feedback loop: Fewer links are used by more ISPs, increasing the hub size (degree) of autonomous systems, and creating more demand for bandwidth because of preferential attachment. Figure 2 shows evidence of this feedback loop in action between 2013 and 2014, when CAIDA measured and reported the changing degrees (number of links) of the top 12 backbone providers. The degree of highly connected systems like Hurricane Electric generally increased, while the degree of less‐connected systems stayed the same or decreased. In other words, high bandwidth and high connectivity attracts more use, which attracts more bandwidth and connectivity, which attracts more use. This self-organizing feedback loop leads to fewer, but larger capacity autonomous systems and physical connections (see Figure 3). Fewer links means less resilience. The Hurricane Electric physical backbone of Figure 3 was analyzed for critical nodes and links (see Figure 4). As expected, the Hurricane Electric network suffers from the same self‐organizing feedback loop—most OSPF traffic depends on only a few links, and there are three blocking nodes. These are the critical links and nodes of the physical infrastructure. As this network is optimized to carry more traffic on the most‐used OSPF links, vulnerability of the entire network to targeted attacks only becomes worse.The bottom line: The physical Internet is evolving away from resiliency toward fragility. Think of it as the interstate highway system where a major freeway is removed every few months to cut costs and optimize traffic by routing more and more traffic through the most‐traveled cities and freeway links. Even if more lanes are added to the overloaded roads, the fact that there are fewer roads leads to bigger catastrophic failures when one is blocked.What should we do? The first step in securing the Internet is to reverse regulatory policy so that it rewards and encourages physical redundancy. The private sector must be motivated to increase redundancy and resiliency even when it costs more. Improvement in cyber security is good for business. Who is not in favor of better security? But, current regulatory policy forces the private sector to do the wrong thing.The public sector (government) must enact smarter regulation, but also, come up to speed on how the Internet actually works. The idea that the Internet is an open unfettered free market is false. The net neutrality decision recently made by the FCC doesn’t open and free the Internet—rather, it captures and regulates it. The current policy of an FCC-regulated Internet will have the same effect on the Internet as the 1996 Telecommunications Act had on the communications industry. It will increase vulnerability through a number of unintended consequences.The second remedy is technical. The OSPF routing policy should be replaced by a random routing policy, and network providers should concentrate on the topology of their networks as much as bandwidth. No one knows what the tradeoff is between congestion and randomization. But we do know that resilience is more expensive than living on the edge. References [1] NSTAC Task Force on Concentration of Assets: Telecom Hotels.

I seriously doubt anyone capable of landing a position in government has a clue about the internet or aspects of it that they currently enjoyIf I'm reading the above correctly, in your opinion, Barack Obama — and his FCC appointees — had no such clue either.It then follows, that the ""Net Neutrality"" rules they instituted were created by clueless people — and undoing them is the right thing to do for that reason alone...Yes. Some things ought to be above the quibbling over political factions.  The # of zip codes is not in question, [google.com] perhaps just the % of them that have three options for internet service.And here we are, once again, reminded of the centuries-old wisdom [monticello.org]: ""That government is best which governs least."" Ajit Pai et al did not rule on whether equal treatment of packets is a good or bad thing. They only decided, it is not up to them...I just happen to side with the decision to implement NN rulesStill, you seem to agree, government should not have involved itself in it in the first place — or, at least, this follows from your skepticism over government officials' competence in such matters.Interesting post. Thanks for it. One point, though:Trump doesn't deserve 50% of America's support - and he'll never have it. He'll die in prison like Paul Manafort.As much as I think an orange jumpsuit would look good on him, I doubt he'll go to prison. He'll pardon himself on the way out -- or at least he'll try, and if it doesn't work, then Pence probably will (just like Ford pardoned Nixon.) And although he does not, and may never have, 50% of America's support, I have to wonder whether 50% of American citizens want to see a former president in the slammer.Trump doesn't deserve 50% of America's support - and he'll never have it.

Nobody in the WH can pardon a state crime. Thanks for pointing that out.Well they also can't pardon themselves or anyone of a crime they're at all involved in.There have been discussions back and forth on this topic ever since the Russia investigation began. One side of the argument is that the POTUS pardon-power is wide-sweeping. On the other side, there is a principle in law (sorry, don't remember where) that ""no man can be his own judge.""So Pence would be too close to be able to pardon Trump.Can the POTUS pardon someone else of a crime if he is also complicit? Excellent question. IANAL, but I suppose the answer is yes, unless it's seen as obstruction of justice. Note the recent hue and cry after Trump hinted that Well they also can't pardon themselves or anyone of a crime they're at all involved in.There have been discussions back and forth on this topic ever since the Russia investigation began.

Note the recent hue and cry after Trump hinted that There is some speculation that Manafort got played and was used to play Trump. The trap isn't just set, it's already been sprung.Notice that they said Manafort was lying very soon after Trump gave his written answers to Mueller. Manafort's legal team and Trump's legal team were known to still be conferring even after Manafort began ""cooperating"". So likely Manafort was planning to feed Trump info on the investigation...Except Mueller is wise to this, and is feeding Manafort BS, knowing the stable genius wil Just like he deserves.Has blown the lid off decorum.Most lying politicians at least TRY not to look like a lying douchebag; Trump is now a definition for it.If we can't put him in prison for what he's done, we have no ""Justice System"", it's a sham.Impeachment is the only route to removing the PresidentTell that to the CIA!Impeachment is the only route to removing the PresidentTell that to the CIA!Trump also appointed former Fox News journalist Heather Nauert as ambassador to the UN.What's up with that ?

Remember that Trump destroys everything he touches....almost, he didn't destroy Nikki Haley but she was such flack that would have been overkill.Do you even know what Net Neutrality is?  How does net neutrality make anything harder for an ISP?  It's almost like an anti-regulation in that it tells them that they're not allowed to do something that's actually more difficult to do than what it requires them to do.  All they have to do is treat all packets equally.Net neutrality is ""OK, you paid for internet access, so here's your internet access.""  A lack of net neutrality is ""OK, you paid for internet access, but if you want to connect to Netflix, Net access to you is just an asset for your ISP to sell to other companiesThat is a fantastic way to put it.access to you is just an asset for your ISP to sell to other companiesThat is a fantastic way to put it.Ex-CIA, pro-incarceration, telecommunications shill, long time political insider and AG under Bush.

But the other side is that without network neutrality, no-one will want to use all the shitty, overpriced applications, even if all the bits arrive like a [highly metered] bat out of hell.A tremendous amount of innovation derives directly from the old adage ""too cheap to meter"".There are things you ca Funny, I would have guessed that the polar opposite of network neutrality was chilling effect.Who else out there is breathlessly awaiting Comcast to bring us the next AlphaZero?They say that a watched pot never boils, without mentioning that an unwatched pot can't boil, for the type of pot where the boiling point goes up as fast as the market will bear.The Internet is mission-critical for everything now.  All roads are on the Internet.  Whoever controls the Internet, controls the world.So, naturally, the telcos believe that they should control the Internet.  They desire access monopolies so they can jack the prices up (and people will pay, because they have to), as well as the ability to burn the candle at both ends.  They also want control over what content everyone can consume; who can access what, so they can stack charges on top of charges without end.  Want netflix?  you have to pay for internet access, pay for netflix, and pay us again to allow netflix on the pipes.  Want facebook too?  You have to pay even more for that.  And, not that you really care, but facebook is having to pay extra for every region of the world in which they want to have their services available at all.And so on.Apart from the king-of-the-world level of wealth they want to suck up, they also want to have influence over what news people can and can't read, and what kinds of political forums people can and can't have online.  That way they can tip the political scales in their favor, to ensure that they never lose their control over everything.They want this as badly as Sauron wants the Ring of Mordor.  And they own far more politicians than you or I ever will.So let me get this straight - what you want to do, is to take the system that works pretty well the way it is now, and place it firmly in the hands of the Trump administration.Along with all our guns, our freedom of speech, the rings of the seven dwarf kings and the rods of the five wizards.We have to give everything to the government, because Trump is LITERALLY HITLER.So let me get this straight - what you want to do, is to take the system that works pretty well the way it is now, and place it firmly in the hands of the Trump administration.Along with all our guns, our freedom of speech, the rings of the seven dwarf kings and the rods of the five wizards.We have to give everything to the government, because Trump is LITERALLY HITLER.He just opposes using regulation to achieve network neutralityNetwork neutrality by definition is regulation.

No, Net Neutrality is by definition regulation to fix other regulation.  ISPs are able to throttle Netflix because they have a monopoly granted to them by the local government.  So even though they degrade Netflix quality, their customers cannot flee to another ISP because the local government has banned competition.  They can then extort Netflix to pay for access to those cust  ISPs are able to throttle Netflix because they have a monopoly granted to them by the local government.  So even though they degrade Netflix quality, their customers cannot flee to another ISP because the local government has banned competition.
This concept is factually wrong, that is, there is no monopoly granted to ISP's.   Anyone can go buy a ""resellable"" INTERNET feed from a carrier like Zayo, Hurricane Electric or Cogent or similar and then build out a local network from that.    The cost to do so is relatively low in the grand scheme of things, especially if technologies like unlicensed wireless are used to do so.   But the repealed network neutrality rules makes it harder for these small, independent, providers to be able to do so.

Especially if they can charge more from the heavier carriages that travel across.Bottom line is, if the telcos have something to gain by holding traffic hostage for ransom in the form of bribes^Wfees for priority, they'll charge for it.If people using that network have something to lose if they don't play ball, they'll pay up.Bullshit.It was Telecom who wrote the anti-NN legislation with lobbyists.It was Republicans who gave industry monopoly abusers everything they ever wanted.It was Comcast liars who tried to charge competitors for their customers using their services ON TOP OF the subscriber fees to access the internet they paid for already.It was LYING FAGGOTS LIKE YOU who tried to conflate the Russian Trollbots who flooded the FCC website with fake shit as if that was a valid sentiment and not complete horseshit spammed ver What we haven't learned from the past is that we are pretty bad at predicting future when it comes to complex systems.So instead of acting from a place of being sure that sometime in the near future Internet will crumble because companies are greedy, try with minimum regulations first, and IF you notice things are coming apart, then introduce a fix.You don't preemptively go for a stomach reduction surgery when a person has normal weight just because they like to eat and food is readily available.

However, they want to throttle because they want to charge you add-on fees for full-speed access to anything they can bilk you for.IF there were enough viable ISP choices for the typical consumer, then the market would indeed solve the problem by itself without the need for regulation. But as most of us know, the average consumer only has between 1 and 3 viable ISP choices, and oligopolies have historically shatted all over consumers.   (The big players already do.)A rule of thumb is you need at least 7 competitors in an area to have sufficient competition to avoid OPEC-like collusion among a few companies.Without regulation, the oligopolies will turn the Internet back into AOL, CompuServe, etc. They will control the content and control where you go, and nickel and dime you if you wander outside their compound. They'll do it simply because they can and you'll have no alternative.Hear hear!The market is continuously fluctuating between healthy competition and virtual monopoly... one end of the spectrum best benefits the consumer, and the other benefits the corporations. Government intervention, ideally, acts like finger on the scale attempting equilibrium. More often than not, the finger is clumsy, but its absence from the markets typically does not favor those rooting for healthy competition.
The Title-II style network neutrality did not do a lot of what network-neutrality proponents seem to think it did.  For instance throttling generally was permitted provided it didn't single out one source.   In addition, ISP's had a lot of latitude as far as what they could or could not do under the guise of 'reasonable network management'.   For instance, an ISP would have been permitted to slow down traffic such as software updates in ord As I mentioned in a different comment, one thing the Title-II regulation did do is saddle ISP's with a lot of paperwork and regulatory hurdles, increasing costs. For a carrier like the large companies which dominate the landscape this wasn't a big deal. For those smaller companies trying to bring another option to the mix, this was much more difficult, and could mean the difference between a viable business and bankruptcy. So the Title-II style network neutrality actually helped prevent the breaking of the oligopoly.To those in power, this is a feature not a bug. To them an oligopoly is a good thing, as it makes it easier for government to exert control and maintain mass surveillance when there are only a handful of carriers/hosters to control, and it makes ""de-platforming"" inconvenient people, opinions, and news from the internet, along with controlling the spread dangerous (to their continued power/wealth) new ideas and concepts, an easier and more effective social manipulation tactic.StratAs I mentioned in a different comment, one thing the Title-II regulation did do is saddle ISP's with a lot of paperwork and regulatory hurdles, increasing costs.

In the wake of the FCC’s decision to roll back net neutrality rules, it started getting dozens of requests a day.Without net neutrality protections, big telecom companies can choose to slow down or block certain sites. If you want to watch Netflix, for example, Comcast could decide to charge you more to access it. A community-run “mesh” network, by contrast, takes back control from corporations: Everyone on the network can agree to keep all content open. When a system is fully running, the people who use it can cancel their contract with a traditional internet service provider and stop paying any monthly bills.[Photo: NYC Mesh]In Manhattan, NYC Mesh put a large antenna on top of a building connected directly to the internet through fiber optic cable. This “supernode,” supported by a network of point-to-point routers that volunteers install on rooftops and windows in the area, provides a fast connection for users in most of downtown. A second supernode is in place in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick, and two more are planned.“I think with around 30 or 40 supernodes we could cover the whole city,” says Brian Hall, a volunteer working on the project. “It’s going to take us a while, but that’s our plan.”It’s something of a return to how the internet originally worked. “One thing that inspires me is that the original idea of the internet was a network of networks,” Hall says. “Different organizations like universities or the Defense Department would form their own network, and then they would join them together, and that is how the internet formed. We’re just getting back to the idea. We formed a network, and we join our network with other networks, and get rid of the ISP layer that we don’t really need.”[Photo: NYC Mesh]Building this type of network can be challenging, and the existing efforts in the U.S. are small. Some projects, like a network attempted in Hoboken, New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy, never took off. In many cases, it’s difficult to get access to the best locations for supernodes. “The people who own masts up on hills or who own tall buildings have become accustomed to the fact that they can charge large monthly rental costs to big ISPs,” says Marc Juul, one of the co-creators of the People’s Open Network, a Bay Area-based mesh network in the early stages in Oakland.Unlike big telecom companies, which rely solely on a small number of these expensive relay points, a mesh network can route internet from house to house. Having a dense network of participants can keep the bandwidth high and makes the network resilient. But building a comprehensive network is also difficult. “One of the problems in starting a mesh network is bootstrapping–how you get a mesh network from nothing to actually existing,” says Juul. “Every time someone comes and wants to be on the mesh, in the beginning, they’re very likely going to be very far away from anyone else on the mesh.”[Photo: NYC Mesh]To start, those who want to be a part of People’s Open Network can buy a cheap, off-the-shelf dual-band router that the group has programmed with open-source mesh software. Once plugged in, it works as both a wireless hotspot and a router. If it’s in range of another router on the mesh network, it automatically connects. But until the network is big enough, people are using the routers differently–continuing to pay a traditional internet service provider, and sharing a little of their bandwidth with others in range. If a volunteer wants to take the next step, they can install an “extender” node on their roof or in a window, pointed at another node in the network.[Photo: NYC Mesh]All of this requires volunteers to install the equipment, which is another challenge. People’s Open Network wants to avoid charging for installation like a traditional ISP, because it doesn’t want to establish a traditional customer service relationship where customers are passive and uninformed. “What we’re trying to do is something horizontal, where everyone is part of the internet,” says Juul. “Everyone is a node on the internet that makes it possible for the internet to exist. We’re really trying not to get into that state of mind where people are thinking that the internet is delivered to them by someone else.”It’s becoming easier as the hardware improves; some new equipment that will be on the market in early 2018 is smaller and simple to mount with a zip tie. People’s Open Network also runs workshops that teach anyone how to install a node. In 2018, the group will likely run a Kickstarter campaign to launch nodes in a large number of homes at once.It’s feasible, they say, for community-run networks like these to eventually replace traditional ISPs. If a community can get cheap internet from a Tier 1 provider–in the Bay Area, the group is working with a company called Hurricane Electric that has a global network and low rates–and because the hardware is getting cheaper, then “you can serve a lot of people for almost no money . . . the bandwidth cost goes toward zero if enough people share it,” he says.In some locations, including large parts of Spain, this type of network is already operational. The Spanish Guifi network has more than 30,000 active nodes. If it can succeed in the U.S., mesh networks could help avoid the problems that come with traditional internet service providers; participants can sign agreements to uphold net neutrality. People’s Open Network others are working on a network commons license that the group plans to adopt next year.The mesh could also eventually replace cell service providers, using hardware built to a new LTE standard that allows anyone to create their own cellular base stations (without the expensive licenses that were previously necessary). “That would really expand what the mesh could be used for,” Juul says.Adele Peters is a staff writer at Fast Company who focuses on solutions to some of the world's largest problems, from climate change to homelessness.

"""Detroit- an unconnected city?Before 2014, Metro Detroit lacked what many other large technologically advanced cities had, an internet exchange. In 2001 an initial attempt was made to bring internet peering to Metro Detroit. Focal Communications launched an internet exchange in Southfield but the exchange never took off and Focal was acquired by Broadwing in 2004. This left Detroit again without an IXP, something unusual for Detroit's size. Michigan ISPs were forced to peer with other ISPs and content providers at internet exchanges in other states. Chicago and Ashburn became common peering points for Michigan based ISPs because of the large exchanges and the relative ease of getting high speed connectivity from Detroit to Chicago and Ashburn.An Interconnectivity Starved Region Gets a Peering Point in 123.Net's Carrier Neutral Data Center123.net, being a well established Michigan based business ISP, was uniquely positioned to launch an internet exchange in Detroit. They had existing private peering established with a a number of local and regional ISPs and own 4 data centers in Michigan. With a primary goal of increasing connectivity to Michigan and lowering bandwidth costs 123.Net founded the Detroit Internet Exchange. It officially launched in 2014 with five members and a total throughput peaking at 6Gbps across 3 switches in 3 data centers.Demand for Content From Netflix, Cloudflare, Google and Others Drive Growth As word of the Detroit Internet exchange traveled to other ISPs more began to join, by the end of 2015 membership had grown to 12 and throughput was peeking at over 10Gbps thanks in part to availability of Netflix content on the exchange. 2016 saw more key members join including one of the largest content distribution networks Akami. In 2017 the Detroit Internet Exchanged added Merit Networks, Hurricane Electric and Google to its members list. In 2018 Rocket Fiber joined and demand for peering with Google has soared causing Google to double its capacity.With the swift growth and future need for 100G ports the Detroit Internet Exchange began to explore upgrading their core switch. Arista got word of the Detroit Internet Exchange story and heard of its rapid growth. Arista decided to generously donate a DCS-7504 N switch to the DET-IX for the benefit of its members. 1, 10, 25 and 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports are now offered. With this hardware upgrade, the DET-IX increased its switching capacity to 38 Tbps!The Detroit Internet Exchange Becomes One of the 50 Largest Peering Hubs Now with the capacity to support 100 Gigabit ports, growth is only expected to continue. Peering with local and regional networks promotes net neutrality by allowing members direct access to content without intermediate ISPs. DET-IX members experience reduced latency and hops by peering to other connected networks. This brings businesses networks closer to their customers, and brings customers closer to members content. Besides better connecting networks, peering also adds real cost savings that ISPs pass on to their customers.How to JoinThe Detroit Internet Exchange (DET-IX) is open to all carriers, Internet Service Providers and enterprise businesses.

When a power failure at the Hurricane Electric data center took this website down for five hours earlier this year, I looked up the Linode service level agreement (SLA) I accepted, and found that I probably made a good cost/benefit choice, but even so it’s worth revisiting at some point.
Upgrading to a platform with significantly higher reliability could be costly though. It means I have to find a hosting company that uses data centers and other infrastructure with a better SLA than Linode apparently has with Hurricane.
I don’t know the details of that SLA, but Linode promises me three nines – 99.9% – uptime, which means its deal with Hurricane should have been at least four nines.
A data center is only one element in Linode’s reliability chain, which includes its own server hardware and Internet bandwidth, among other things. In order to get three nines of overall reliability, you have to, for example, string together a system comprised of ten or fewer elements with four nines: when probabilities are lined up in a series, the chances of failure add up. So if there are ten elements in a row each with a .01% chance of failure, the overall chance of failure is .1%. A data center promising four nines (which is a pretty pathetic SLA) is, in effect, promising to be down for less than an hour a year.
For the sake of simplicity, I’m ignoring the effect of running elements in parallel – that’s a way to build a high reliability system out of lower reliability elements. Either way you do it, it costs a lot of money to buy yourself an extra nine. At this point, it’s a lot more money than a few extra hours of uptime would be worth to me.
But that’s just for now and just for me. Any business that relies on telecoms and IT infrastructure – in house or outsourced – needs to run the same cost/benefit analysis, make its choice and make sure it can live with the consequences.""",,,

"""Approximately three weeks ago, the FCC voted to rescind the 2015 Open Internet Order with an order called Restoring Internet Freedom [you can read my take, if you want]. Many people see this as a direct attack on net neutrality. It rolls back protections which prevent companies from throttling traffic from edge services like Netflix and charging those companies additional charges to restore the previous level of service to them. This has sent many people searching for way to protect their internet access.People are now looking at:All of these are actually great options for very specific use cases, but ensuring net neutrality is not one of them. All have weaknesses when it comes to maintaining a strong form of net neutrality. The biggest problem is ignoring the shape of the networks and how they interact with the internet. The only way around this is to build our own community owned ISPs. Every other attempt at net neutrality cannot bypass the control now given to Broadband Internet Providers to limit and shape traffic traveling through their networks between our computers and the internet proper.Only by replacing ISPs with our own providers built to be more open from the ground up, can we bypass their newfound ability to control what travels over their networks.Let’s take a look at a VPN scenario. A VPN is wonderful for hiding network traffic as it traverses from a computer to the VPN server. This means requests for web content and responses from web servers, including video streaming from Netflix or Youtube, can’t be inspected anywhere from the computer making those requests through to the VPN edge service; but it is fair game after it gets to the VPNs network. The VPN edge service will use its own IP transport provider to finish making the requests so it looks like the requests are coming from the VPN server, but this part is open for inspection unless it’s using HTTPS or some other secured protocol — but even then the IP transport provider sees the connection being made to a specific server. If the VPN edge service uses CenturyLink (previously Level 3) to reach out to Netflix, CenturyLink can charge them extra for transporting so much video traffic. Additionally, the originating computer’s IP transport provider (typically and ISP) can now charge the VPN edge service a transport surcharge for so much bandwidth usage. All these fees will be passed on to the edge provider’s customers which means the cost of VPNs, Netflix, and Youtube will go up. This means more ad revenue is needed to support freemium business models and it means a worse experience for more people. Please don’t use a VPN to watch videos.In the case of an overlay network, one might think that everything would all work out and one’s traffic would be fully anonymized. That’s not the case. That only works for short lived requests, where it can route each request and response over different paths on the network. When the request is for video, the response is a stream which has to be routed over a steady route or it might experience a lot of hiccups. If the overlay network has some ordering guarantee because one of the nodes is willing to do a ton of work to break up the stream and send it over multiple paths, then the stream might be able to be buffered and replayed locally without too many problems. An ISP could easily cut off certain kinds of traffic which could put an end to an overlay network. If the goal of using the overlay network was to maintain anonymity, streaming video without built-in multicast support from the overlay network is a perfect way of giving away one’s location and, possibly, identity. If the goal was to maximize the number of routes the video took to get to one’s computer in an attempt to minimize bandwidth going through each node, this might work if one exit node is willing to do a lot of work in routing the data coming from the streaming service. On the other hand, it might also just drive up bandwidth usage across several nodes and IP transport providers. This could still have the effect of raising IP traffic settlement costs to those nodes.P2P hosting is one way of bringing the control of the internet back into the hands of the people. Unfortunately, it is plagued by a paradox of giving people control and the ability to create their own content to share far and wide, while at the same time suffering from lack of adoption because people just want to use Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, and Spotify — none of which would be willing to switch to a P2P architecture. If we all collectively decided that P2P was the way to go, we could make our own distributed Facebook-like service. We could make our own TV shows and let people download the shows and watch them, but with internet access as it is in the US, we couldn’t stream the video from our computers at scale — unless we seed content like Napster and Bittorrent. Our upstream speeds are too slow for streaming at scale without central servers which can handle multicasting.P2P hosting is another avenue where ISPs can shape traffic and make it impossible to access content on one’s personal server from anywhere outside one’s home network. As long as the goal of having a P2P server is to allow the greater world to access one’s content, doing away with net neutrality does away with being able to reliably serve content from one’s home — depending on what one’s ISP thinks “reasonable network management practices” are — unless one is willing to pay for incoming connections. The people behind Holo think it’s highly unlikely, but they agree that ultimately this would need to fund a mesh network.Community Wireless Mesh is one way of providing more internet access to more people. Typically these networks are set up with a bunch of wireless routers all in close proximity of each other. Nodes with an internet connection are called exit nodes, as all requests to the internet exit the mesh network at those nodes. If networks are constructed like this, the access to the internet is still dependent on one or more ISPs.Projects like the People’s Open Network based out of Oakland, CA is talking about buying bandwidth from Hurricane Electric. If they do this, they can effectively bypass ISPs and have direct connectivity with the larger internet. They will still have a problem to solve of effectively distributing high bandwidth internet. They will have to start doing what Detroit’s Equitable Internet Initiative has done. They have bought dark fiber with gigabit bandwidth and are using it to provide high speed internet access to people via high speed wireless networks which span the city and branch out.Optimally, a community will be able to develop to the point where it owns all of it’s infrastructure. Hopefully, it will have fiber to all the houses, but in some cases the existing cable and telephone infrastructure will be bought by the community and taken over by the NOC. If any ISP business want to be started locally, the can use the cities NOC and provide additional services on top. An example of this would be the Ashland Fiber Network in Ashland, OR. They own all the cable and fiber network. Charter communications and several other ISPs provide additional services and customer service beyond what the NOC provides. Tech savy people can just deal with the NOC directly and pay the city for internet access.Communities need their people to organize into their own ISP cooperatives. Geeks Without Bounds is starting to raise funds to help communities do exactly this and there may be other organizations following in suite. Only by replacing ISPs with our own providers built to be more open from the ground up, can we bypass their newfound ability to control what travels over their networks. If enough communities build their own high speed wireless networks, we can connect each network together across the country and truly build a more spacious, open internet for all.Written byWritten by""",,,

The core of the Internet, the closest thing it has to a ""backbone,"" is a dozen or so networks consisting of data centers throughout the world. These networks, operated by private businesses, are called ""Tier 1"" because they can reach every part of the Internet simply by peering with one another. Two Tier 1 networks peer with each by configuring routers at multiple data centers to pass traffic back and forth. Peering is a point-to-point connection only, which doesn't necessarily guarantee passage of traffic to any networks beyond the two involved in the deal.""Both providers have a large router, a Cisco or Juniper router, and they agree to interconnect them,"" Mark Taylor, VP of media and IP services at Level 3, told Ars. For example, he said, ""A 10Gbps port on one is connected to a 10Gbps port on another. The only traffic that can flow between those connections are between the respective customers of both parties.""Tier 1 networks don't need to buy ""transit""—an arrangement where one company pays another to accept its traffic and distribute it to all networks connected to the Internet. Smaller networks do, although even companies as big as Comcast buy transit.Peering and transit are essential to Netflix and YouTube traffic. The Internet backbone providers that Netflix and Google pay to carry their traffic to the rest of the Internet need robust connections to other networks to ensure delivery of streaming videos to customers of all ISPs. Netflix and Google also offer to peer directly with ISPs to give videos a more direct path to customers' homes.(For more discussion of peering and transit, see Peter Bright's article ""Can a DDoS break the Internet? Sure… just not all of it."")Defining which networks are ""Tier 1"" isn't as simple as you might expect. The volunteer editors at Wikipedia have listed Tier 1 networks as AT&T, CenturyLink, Deutsche Telekom, XO Communications, Telecom Italia, GTT, Verizon, Sprint, TeliaSonera International Carrier, NTT, Level 3, Tata Communications, and Zayo Group. The list is probably not complete. Wikipedia calls Cogent and Orange ""major networks"" but not Tier 1s, meaning they don't have to buy transit but do pay for peering. (Cogent denies this, telling Ars that it pays no other provider for interconnectivity.)Whether payment should disqualify a network from being labeled ""Tier 1"" is under dispute. A packet is routed across the Internet exactly the same way whether it is routed as the result of a free peering agreement or whether it is routed as part of a paid peering agreement, notes Martin Levy, director of IPv6 strategy at IP transit provider Hurricane Electric. Hurricane says it is a Tier 1 network for IPv6 traffic, though not for IPv4 traffic.The reason financial agreements are important isn't so much the semantic question of who is a Tier 1 network; it's that disagreements over whether payments should be made end up harming the quality of end-user connections.""Everybody always wants to get paid,"" Rudolf van der Berg, an economist and policy analyst for OECD (and author of ""How the ‘Net works: an introduction to peering and transit""), told Ars. ""If I had the choice between paying you, peering with you, or getting paid by you, I would choose getting paid by you. It doesn't necessarily mean the other party is interested in paying. And that's the problem here.""Peering without payment—""settlement-free"" peering—occurs quite often between networks of roughly equal size and negotiating power.""The word peering generally is synonymous with settlement-free,"" Taylor said. ""There is an agreement by both parties that there is an equal benefit by each to connect to the two networks.""Typical peering agreements between US-based Tier 1 networks involve connections in six to 10 locations across the US, mainly in major cities, Forster said. XO also peers with providers in London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt.A crucial part of peering agreements is upgrading connections when they start to fill, because congested ports slow down the rate at which bits flow between the networks. That's what happened when Verizon refused to add as many ports to its connections with Cogent as Cogent felt was necessary. Verizon FiOS Customers promptly complained on Verizon support forums when their Netflix video playback got dramatically worse.""Typically what happened is when the connections reached about 50 percent utilization, the two parties agreed to upgrade them and they would be upgraded in a timely manner,"" Cogent CEO Dave Schaeffer told Ars. ""Over the past year or so, as we have continued to pick up Netflix traffic, Verizon has continuously slowed down the rate of upgrading those connections, allowing the interconnections to become totally saturated and therefore degrading the quality of throughput.""Schaeffer said this is true of all the big players to varying degrees, naming Comcast, Time Warner, CenturyLink, and AT&T. Out of those, he said that ""AT&T is the best behaved of the bunch.""Letting ports fill up can be a negotiating tactic. Verizon and Cogent each have to spend about $10,000 for equipment when a port is added, Schaeffer said—pocket change for companies of this size. But instead of the companies sharing equal costs, Verizon wants Cogent to pay because more traffic is flowing from Cogent to Verizon than vice versa.""When the traffic loads are not symmetric, the provider with the heavier load typically pays the other for transit,"" Verizon said in a blog post. Cogent doesn't want to pay and says the traffic loads are unequal because Verizon customers are requesting so many Netflix videos. Negotiations are surely ongoing behind the scenes, but no agreement has been announced.The dispute is similar to the one that happened in late 2010, when Comcast demanded payment from Level 3 in order to carry Netflix traffic. The dispute didn't get to the point where ports were saturated. ""We, under protest, agreed to pay,"" Taylor told Ars. This month, nearly three years after the dispute began, the companies released a joint statement. ""Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released,"" it said.""The funny thing"" about these disputes is how little money is involved, van der Berg said. The French telecom regulator ARCEP has found that money changing hands between operators for peering and transit, plus the amount paid to third parties that host Internet exchange points, is equal to just 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent of revenue generated by the supply of Internet access to end users.One obvious question to ask is whether ISPs refusing to upgrade peering connections could violate net neutrality laws. The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Open Internet Order prevents ISPs from blocking content or unreasonably discriminating against third-party traffic. ISPs that sell their own video services while simultaneously degrading other video traffic might seem to be violating the principles of net neutrality, but they're likely not violating the letter of the law.The FCC's Open Internet Order makes only one reference to peering: ""We do not intend our rules to affect existing arrangements for network interconnection, including existing paid peering arrangements.""Susan Crawford, a former tech policy advisor to President Obama and author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry & Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age, told Ars via e-mail that this exception for network interconnection agreements including paid peering ""is an enormous problem. If we focus only on discrimination vis a vis users' access to applications, we're missing a huge part of the story. Network operators in the US are now sufficiently powerful that they can pinch traffic farther upstream as well as pinch traffic in the last mile.""It's easy to see why more traffic flows from Cogent to Verizon than vice versa. Cogent is one of Netflix's Internet service providers—Netflix pays Cogent for transit, to carry its traffic to the rest of the Internet. Many Verizon customers, meanwhile, pay Netflix to stream video. Each time a Netflix customer using Verizon's network clicks on a Netflix video, that click sends just a tiny bit of traffic to Verizon and then on to Cogent and Netflix. In return, that customer receives a flood of data—up to 2.8GB for each hour of high-definition content.This is just how the last-mile ISPs want it, apparently, since they have made it difficult for customers to send as much traffic as they receive by providing far lower upload speeds than download speeds. Even customers who might try to achieve some upload/download parity—perhaps by using backup services to replicate all of their data—will find that hard to do.Everyone involved in sending Netflix traffic to customers is getting compensated. Verizon and Netflix get paid by home Internet users, and Cogent is paid by Netflix. Verizon wants to get paid twice—by its own Internet customers and by Cogent.The question of whether Cogent should pay Verizon comes down in part to the question of who causes the traffic. Did Netflix ""cause"" the traffic by offering streaming content over the Internet? Or did Verizon cause the traffic by providing Internet service to customers who expect access to Netflix videos?""Verizon has chosen to sell its customers a product that they hope those customers don't actually use,"" Schaeffer said. ""And when customers use it and request movies, they have not ensured there is adequate connectivity to get that video content back to their customers.""Schaeffer accused Verizon of favoring its own services. ""Verizon is trying to incent customers to buy its video product, its Redbox product, as opposed to using competitive products of Netflix and others,"" he said.Verizon might turn Schaeffer's arguments on their head, saying Netflix is selling a streaming video service without ensuring that the videos have a clear path to all customers. Verizon declined repeated interview requests from Ars, however, as did the majority of companies involved in these disputes. Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and CenturyLink did not answer questions or make anyone available for interviews. Google and Netflix both declined to say anything on the record. AT&T did not respond to e-mails. Three European players involved in disputes—Free, Orange, Deutsche Telekom—did not reply to e-mails. Telefónica responded that ""we can’t comment on regulatory cases that are ongoing except to say that Telefónica is cooperating fully."" The FCC did not make anyone available for an interview or answer our questions.Since ISPs have argued that YouTube, Netflix, and other video services should pay for access to customers, they're actually seeking payment from three sources: their own customers, the online video providers, and Tier 1 networks like Cogent and Level 3.When asked if ISPs are degrading Netflix and YouTube traffic to steer users toward their own video services, Crawford told Ars that ""the very powerful eyeball networks in the US (and particularly Comcast and Time Warner Cable) have ample incentive and ability to protect the IP services in which they have economic interests. Their real goal, however, is simpler and richer. They have enormous incentives to build a moat around their high-speed data networks and charge for entry because data is a very high-margin (north of 95 percent for the cable companies), addictive, utility product over which they have local monopoly control. They have told Wall Street they will do this. Yes, charging for entry serves the same purposes as discrimination in favor of their own VOD [video-on-demand], but it is a richer and blunter proposition for them.""You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

"""The Internet has no backbone. Let’s get that out of the way right now. If you want to think about it in terms of anatomy, you’re better off thinking about squids or octopi, although those aren’t very good either since there is a central point of “intelligence” in both of those cases. You may be wondering why I’m starting off with such a strong statement, especially without clearly coming up with an apt analogy to replace the backbone one. Let me back up. I was invited to discuss the concept of Net Neutrality and the recent ruling by a court striking it down. The invitation came from the local television station WCAX by way of Champlain College. You can watch the brief interview at this link. Net Neutrality is the idea that all traffic that flows across the Internet should be treated equally. What this means is that providers can’t discriminate between one type of application traffic and another. In reality, the Internet Protocol (IP) is designed to do just this and providers have been using one form of it or another for years. They prioritize or may prioritize one type of traffic over another, depending on a variety of factors including customers paying them. Some applications like Skype or Vonage or even Netflix and Amazon Streaming are very time sensitive. It may be helpful to have traffic from those applications get a higher priority over, say, search requests to Google. What happened, though, and has been happening is that providers like Comcast have been blocking peer to peer file sharing services like BitTorrents. Before that, it was the file sharing networks behind Limewire and Kazaa. As I said, this has been going on for years. In 2010, our friends at the Federal Candy Company (FCC) decided to actually pass a regulation requiring that providers don’t prefer any application traffic over another. Later, they decided to go after Comcast for blocking file sharing traffic. File sharing traffic has a couple of concerns that are attached to it. The first is the bandwidth that it uses as people are not only downloading but also uploading. The second is that in many cases, the files being shared violate copyright meaning the action is simply illegal. Comcast is less concerned with the legality of the action than they are with the fact that customers are passing a lot of traffic around. This is where we circle back to the initial statement that the Internet has no backbone. The Internet is really a very large collection of networks that are connected together. How are they connected together? In some cases, smaller networks pay larger networks to connect with them. This is what we call transit where the smaller company pays the bigger company to carry traffic to other networks for them. If two network providers are roughly the same size, it makes sense for those two providers to just throw a network cable over a wall where they are both located and pass traffic back and forth without any payment involved. This assumes that the two providers are sending more or less the same amount of traffic to one another meaning that there is a benefit to both providers. In some cases, networks that have a lot of content providers like ESPN, Disney, CNN, Facebook or Twitter may find it helpful to connect directly to networks where there are a lot of eyeballs like Comcast or Charter. The provider that has content customers can tell those customers they can get to the eyeballs quickly by connecting directly with the eyeball networks. They get more customers that way. We can take a look at something called a traceroute, that shows us the path through the Internet from one location to another. If we look closely at the output from the traceroute, we can see different networks that we pass through. In some cases, you may pass through multiple networks on your way from one to another. In that cases, the middle networks are being used as transit to get from one network to another. In the traceroute output below, we go through Comcast where we started from my laptop and then through Global Crossing (glbx), Hurricane Electric (he) and then to Teljet before getting to our target, which is the mail server at Champlain College.  3  te-5-4-ur01.williston.vt.boston.comcast.net (68.87.158.113)  95.746 ms  27.177 ms  24.429 ms 4  be-79-ar01.needham.ma.boston.comcast.net (68.85.162.45)  25.583 ms  21.388 ms  25.342 ms 5  he-2-8-0-0-cr01.newyork.ny.ibone.comcast.net (68.86.93.185)  30.190 ms  100.740 ms  69.874 ms 6  * * 23.30.206.166 (23.30.206.166)  52.093 ms 7  po2-10g.ar8.nyc1.gblx.net (67.16.137.98)  50.148 ms  43.071 ms    te4-3-10g.ar8.nyc1.gblx.net (67.16.143.26)  57.416 ms 8  hurricane-electric-llc-new-york.tengigabitethernet1-3.ar5.nyc1.gblx.net (64.209.92.98)  70.405 ms  78.584 ms  57.481 ms 9  10ge3-1.core1.nyc6.he.net (184.105.222.82)  67.895 ms  57.869 ms  61.966 ms10  teljet-longhaul-llc.10gigabitethernet1-3.core1.nyc6.he.net (216.66.30.118)  142.279 ms  170.087 ms  494.677 ms11  v12.te-1-1.core1.burlvt.teljet.net (64.25.208.186)  55.829 ms  224.185 ms  64.438 ms12  ppp-64-25-209-165.teljet.com (64.25.209.165)  74.102 ms  70.441 ms  80.518 ms What does this have to do with Net Neutrality and networks like Comcast? If Comcast customers start to use a lot of traffic out of the Comcast network, it will start to look lopsided to the networks Comcast peers with. Once Comcast starts to send a lot of traffic out to other places in the world, they start being something other than a prized eyeball network. They start needing other network providers to pass traffic out to the rest of the world. They are no longer a peer, they are just another transit customer and that means they might need to start paying for their connections to other networks. It helps them keep their network costs down when they limit the amount of traffic you can send out. The same goes for providers like Verizon and Fairpoint who offer DSL. From a technical standpoint, there is no reason why you couldn’t have the same amount of bandwidth going out as going in, but it’s more beneficial for your provider if you are simply an eyeball. They can sell your eyeballs to other providers to get free connections to the rest of the world. Another problem is that the Internet is changing. Services available today like Netflix, Amazon, Skype and even making use of Apple products require a lot of bandwidth. The world is moving to the cloud and the cloud requires that you have a lot of readily available bandwidth. In the early days of consumer-based service providers you had companies like AOL, CompuServe, NetZero and several others that offered Internet access to people. These companies were in the business of providing Internet access and in many cases that’s all they did. Now, the cable companies in the US have captured a huge share of the consumer market for Internet access. Services like YouTube, Netflix and many others use a lot of bandwidth. These services are in competition with the core business of your provider — providing televisual services to you. Charging you a lot of money for television and hardware and other similar services related to cable television is how these companies make a lot of money. Internet access doesn’t make them nearly as much. Once they start to lose customers of their cable services to Internet-based services like Netflix, YouTube and Hulu, they will need to make more money from their Internet services. The same is true of a company like Verizon. Verizon makes money from offering phone services. When you start making use of services like Vonage, MagicJack and Skype, not to mention Google Hangouts and other similar services, you start to cut into the revenue stream the company makes from their telephone services. Again, you aren’t paying much for Internet access. Certainly not enough to offset the revenue they make from their telephone services. We’re back to Net Neutrality. When these companies reach the breaking point where they are making less money from their cash cow businesses, they will need a way to offset that. Without a rule to keep providers from discriminating over traffic, these providers can start blocking their competing services and then forcing you to pay higher rates to get those services back. Net Neutrality keeps the playing field level but it does even more than that. In many if not most cases, you don’t have much of a choice for an Internet provider because cable companies have monopolies in their service areas and they managed to squeeze their competition out. I say cable providers but in some cases it’s companies like Verizon and AT&T offering television services over fiber. Without any other place to go, customers will be forced to pay the higher rates to continue their streaming services. Either that or the companies like Netflix will be forced to pay for the eyeballs and they will pass that cost along to their customers. Is Net Neutrality an important concept? Yes, it is. We run the risk of continuing to marginalize a service that is opening up the world for a lot of people. When people have to pay a lot of money for Internet service, they will drop to lower levels which will prevent companies from developing better services because they won’t have customers that can make use of them. This is the fear that led to Net Neutrality. Congress won’t regulate in part because the cable companies have lobbyists with deep pockets and a lot of influence. The courts say the FCC can’t because it oversteps its boundaries. That doesn’t leave anyone who may be able to protect customers and ensure the Internet is a place for innovation and progress.

"""NYC Mesh is a physical network of interconnected routers and a group of enthusiasts working to support the expansion of the project as a freely accessible, open, wireless community network. NYC Mesh is not an  internet service provider (ISP), although it does connect to the internet and offer internet access as a service to members. The network includes over 600 active member nodes throughout the five boroughs of New York City, with concentrations of users in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn.[1]
The goal of NYC Mesh is to build a large scale, decentralized digital network, owned by those who run it, that will eventually cover all of New York City and neighboring urban areas.[1]
Participation in the project is governed by its Network Commons License.[2]
This agreement, partially modeled on a similar license in use by Guifi.net, lists four key tenets:
Other similar projects include Freifunk in Germany, Ninux in Italy, Sarantaporo.gr in Greece, the People's Open Network in Oakland, CA, and Red Hook Wi-Fi in Brooklyn, NY.[3]
Like many other free community-driven networks, NYC Mesh uses mesh technology to facilitate robustness and resiliency. Additionally, between larger nodes, the project uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Nodes are connected via WiFi links similar to those used by wireless routers in homes, but with more powerful routers that are able to function as a backbone, making connections at distances up to a mile.[4]
NYC Mesh was founded in 2012 and was originally based on the Cjdns protocol.[5]
In 2015 the project received a grant from ISOC-NY, the New York chapter of the Internet Society.[6]
NYC Mesh connects to the internet via the DE-CIX internet exchange point (IXP) at its first super node, Sabey Data Center at 375 Pearl Street,[7] peering with companies such as Akamai, Apple, Google, and Hurricane Electric.[8] Later, another supernode was opened up on the roof of Cologuard Brooklyn, another data center.
The project received a membership boost due to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission vote in December 2017 to repeal its 2015 net neutrality rules. Coinciding with this decision, the average number of member sign-ups requests per month jumped from about 20 to over 400.[1][9]""",,,

                Network Engineering Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for network engineers. It only takes a minute to sign up.In this NPR article there is mentioned 'network neutrality' with very little details on what it actually is or how it actually works. I tried researching it on my own but I get a lot of non-technical explanations of what it is fighting against (essentially metering internet traffic speeds) but I am very confused as to how this works.My understanding of the internet (broadly) is that user Joe opens up a connection with website npr.com via the HTTP protocol (after some DNS work) which sends and receives data to and from NPR's server utilizing both NPR's and Joe's upload and download speeds.Where is the throttling occurring? Am I missing a crucial step? Is the 'traffic' being throttled 'on the way' to the client/server somewhat like a tollbooth at the ISP level?The NPR article brings up the example of how one website could pay to have their traffic go to the user faster. I just don't understand this because isn't all my incoming traffic maxed out at whatever my download speed is? Further, isn't the server maxed out at whatever their upload speed is? For example, if I try to send 1MB of data from a server (www.mysimplesite.com) with an upload speed of 1MB/s to a client (joe) who has a download speed of 1mb/s would this transfer not happen in the same [theoretical] time as a server (www.thesuperubersite.com) with an upload speed of 2MB/s? I fail to see how any server can pay to have their content 'reach the user faster' if it is the client who generally is the speed limitation. From a technical perspective,  how would this work?  I'm also not looking for an analogy or opinions.Network neutrality effectively governs how providers can handle traffic. It's a broad concept in theory, with potential upsides and downsides in practice. Consensus seems to be the downsides might be fairly harmful to consumers and startups.  In the absence of net neutrality, internet service providers and the big businesses with the budget to support them would win – with consumers and internet startups losing. In theory, abolishing net neutrality would allow ISPs like Verizon to decide for themselves whether or not they want to provide VoIP traffic, or any other traffic type, to traverse their networks. Other Tier 1 providers would be free to do the same.To be fair, internet in the US isn't currently operated under perfect net neutrality rules. Information freedom is increasingly eroding around the edges of the law, with an egregious, perhaps extortive agreement taking place earlier this year between Netflix and Comcast. Comcast makes up a significant portion of Netflix’s customer base; the video streaming service was all but forced to pay up. This eventually caused Netflix to raise its prices (however slightly), thus, altering their business model and harming consumers. If net neutrality is to fail completely, then expect more deals like this.As for your question:Where is the throttling occurring? Am I missing a crucial step? Is the
  'traffic' being throttled 'on the way' to the client/server somewhat
  like a tollbooth at the ISP level?When you think of throttling, think of quality of service.  Most points of the internet work on the principle of oversubscription, which makes more effective use of infrastructure.  So even if you have a 1Gb/s internet connection, you probably won't be getting 1Gb/s service. That's because Tier 1 internet providers' backbones aren’t capable of sustaining 1Gb/s for millions of customers.I fail to see how any server can pay to have their content 'reach the
  user faster' if it is the client who generally is the speed
  limitation. From a technical perspective, how would this work?A provider has the ability to service packets as they see fit.  At micro-scale, imagine you have 2 users connected via a 100Mb connection to separate providers with each provider peering through a 100Mb connection to one another. If either provider decides those users are less important than any other customer they have, they can shape that traffic to be lower priority than anything else, meaning they have the capability of being dropped first if there isn’t enough bandwidth to support them.  It's also important to point out that those packets may not make it to the consumer at all.  It is entirely possible to drop packets altogether if they fall outside the threshold those providers provisioned.This is a large issue with many nuances, and one that has valid concerns on both sides of the issue.To get to the heart of this matter, you need to understand that the Internet is not a single entity.  It is made up of a large number of individual networks that are inter-connected.A consumer pays an ISP to connect their personal network to the ISP's network.  The ISP may be paying another service provider (often more than one) to connect to their network or the ISP could be a major carrier themselves (i.e. providing large bandwidth connectivity over large geographic areas).  These larger carriers interconnect (or peer) with each other at multiple peering points (data centers where they each have a presence). The services to which the consumer wants access are either consumers themselves or may operate large networks of their own.The other concept to understand is that the internet was largely built on an ""over-subscription"" model to keep costs low.  What this means is that if a ISP/carrier had a certain amount of network capacity, they might sell 10-30 times this amount of bandwidth to customers, knowing that customers don't use all the capacity they pay for 100% of the time.  With ""always on"" internet and consumers using their bandwidth more (both total and average), this ability to over subscribe has been significantly diminished. Since ISPs/carriers are looking to expand their network capacity  and don't want to increase costs to customers (who may choose to move elsewhere if they do), they are looking at other ways to increase revenues to offset the additional costs.Some of the ways that parties are looking to increase revenues involves treating traffic differently based on the source and/or destination of the traffic.  The intent of net neutrality policies would be to prevent providers from treating traffic differently, no matter where it is sourced or destined.So let's use an example to illustrate some of the issues. To get information from a service such as Netflix a request goes from the consumer's network, to their ISP's network, possibly to one or more carrier networks (for this example, let's say A and then B), and finally to the Netflix network.  For simplicity, we will assume the reverse path is the same.If both the consumer and Netflix were connected to the same ISP/carrier, there would be no issue as the ISP/carrier would be getting paid by both parties.  However in the example I provided, the ISP is paid by the consumer and Carrier B is paid by Netflix.  Carrier A isn't compensated directly by either the consumer or Netflix, even though it may carry the data further geographically than anyone else along the path.Let's look at a few potential cases that already have their seeds in real world practices:1-Carrier ACarrier A is passing a lot of data that isn't originated or destined for someone on their network.  They are not getting paid by either party directly.Carrier A feels that since there is a large amount of data from Netflix passing through it's network (neither sourced or destined for their network), it feels that they should be further compensated for this, and wants Netflix (or possibly Carrier B) to pay them for this traffic.Netflix doesn't see a need to pay Carrier A, so Carrier A looks at some of the things it can do (to reduce costs for running their network, make their network better for their customers, and/or make it more desirable for Netflix to pay them):2-ISP with NetflixThe ISP on the other hand, while getting paid by the consumer notices that the vast majority of the traffic is coming from outside it's network and going to the consumer. The increased bandwidth usage means they need to expand the capacity of their network, but they don't want to increase prices to consumers, and believe Netflix should compensate them.This results in the same situation as above, with the ISP thinking along the same lines as Carrier A.3-ISP with ConsumerThe ISP decides to offer a ""premium"" service to consumers, if they want to pay more.  This would give the premium consumers' traffic priority during peak times when the ISP's network might be short on capacity.  Non-premium customers may notice increased latency and lower speeds during these times.In my mind, this is an artificially created revenue stream, much like some ISPs that charged a premium for ""always on"" DSL/cable service.  They are creating a perceived need that isn't really necessary so their customers feel better about paying more for the service.  Basically, it allows them to raise their rates in a way where the consumer feels better about what they are paying for rather than getting upset.Network neutrality is the principle that an ISP must treat all network traffic equally, regardless of source or destination.  This means that, for instance, if your ISP provides a VoIP telephone service, or a cable TV service, they can't prioritize their own offerings over third party service.
If they are allowed to prioritize their own services, then they can basically force their customers into their own non-internet offerings, simply by degrading the performance of their competitors.
The flip side of this, which is what happened to Netflix, is that, with network neutrality, the John Smith pays their ISP, and Netflix pays their ISP, and that's it.  Without net neutrality, John Smith's ISP can demand payment from Netflix in order for Netflix to be able to provide their service to John Smith.  Basically, John Smith's ISP gets paid by both John Smith and Netflix, even though Netflix is already paying their own ISP bill.
The ultimate extreme of the collapse of net neutrality is that an ISP customer in the US with relatives in England would have to pay both their US ISP, and the ISP in the UK, and the English relatives would have to pay both the US and UK ISPs, also.  Add in the ISP of every other person or company in the world that you might want to communicate with, and you'd be paying hundreds of bills every month, just to be able to use the ""global"" internet.
Basically, the ISPs want to take the internet back to the late 80s, where you had Compuserve, AOL, and a bunch of other ""online services"" that didn't actually connect to each other.  So, Compuserve customers could only access Compuserve services.The technical part of doing this is actually remarkably easy.  ISPs can prioritize traffic right now, for various reasons.  For example, VoIP traffic could be prioritized above email traffic, since VoIP requires much lower latency connections to prevent dropouts.  This is perfectly valid and legal, even with net neutrality.  It's basically just setting a rule in a router, that, say, 50% of bandwidth should be used for VoIP, 40% for web browsing, and 10% for email. But, this prioritization can also be done based on source or destination.  This is what the ISPs want to do.  So, traffic from Netflix could be set to only use 10% of Comcast's bandwidth, unless Netflix pays Comcast money, despite the fact that Netflix is not a customer of Comcast.  Meanwhile, Comcast's streaming video service could be set to use 90% of bandwidth, basically killing Netflix on Comcast's network.Each ISP can control the end-to-end experience (the speed, latency) by selectively applying Quality of service (QOS) and routing decisions based on the traffic source/destinatoin.So an ISP could provide premium (higher QOS, over higher cost/faster/fewer-hops links) service to/from service providers that pay a premium. So if Netflix pays, and gets the premium, but (for example) Hulu didn't... customers would start thinking ""Hulu sucks. Netflix if fast!"" when in reality, the invisible-to-the-user ISP service is affecting performance.The big issue people have (I think) is that it means that (for example) the big players (e.g. Netflix) can spend big money for premium ISP through-carry and make it hard/impossible for small players (netflix startup competitor that might come some day) to get the same level of service to the end users.To date, the Internet has been one big level playing field ""in the middle""; A ""neutral network.""(...and see Ryan Foley's answer which has more technical clarity than my attempt.)The internet is not far from becoming just like any other utility (water, power, etc) -- something you assume everyone needs and has a right to have.  Net Neutrality would make it so the ISP (Internet Service Providers) can only provide you with a link to the Internet.  Nothing more.  Which is a GOOD thing.  Just like your power and water company, they provide you with power and water.  They don't care whether you use a refrigerator from Kenmore, or Sears, or GE, or Whirlpool, etc.The current bill would allow ISP to charge premiums for faster access to certain services/websites.  Something like a faster download rate when browsing youtube, or watching videos on netflix, etc.The best comparison is to continue comparing the Internet to a utility service.  What if your power company could charge you more to ensure a better power stream when you are using (for example) General Electric devices (your fridge, your toaster, etc).  But, what if you own a Kenmore refrigerate, are you out of luck?  Left to accept just the bare minimum your power company will give you in so far as power.People would be outraged if the Power Company all of a sudden imposed fees to power certain company's devices, while trying to avoid blame by stating that you always have the option to not pay the fees for a lesser service.Replace the ""power company"" with ""your local ISP"" and replace ""a company's electronic devices"" with various online businesses (ebay, netflix, youtube, amazon VoD, etc).  The problem is, once they start ""charging a premium for certain sites"", its only a matter of time before all the remaining sites end up having terrible service.  Which takes your choice away, as the consumer, because you will be forced to choose (and pay more for) the service that your ISP happens to support.The throttling most oftens happens at the carrier that is near the client, but can potentially occur within any transit carrier or non-transit carrier. Throttling actions can occur on a particular pattern of traffic from Layer 3 to Layer 7, and can occur in many ways, whether it is lowering the priority of the traffic in queue, imposing absolute bandwidth limitations, reducing the share of overall bandwidth that the traffic has available to use, or outright blocking the traffic altogether. Throttling most often occurs when the service integrity of a carrier is threatened by a particular pattern of overwhelming usage. First, the overwhelming traffic pattern that threatens overall user experience is identified, then the best manner of throttling is determined that does not further threaten the service of the overall customer base. Patterns of overwhelming usage is a common concern of any service provider, and many businesses maintain a policy based on the likelihood of the event. For example, rolling brownouts and customer notifications when power usage spikes during peak hours, or lane closures and traffic redirection during large attendance at entertainment venues.The client experiences throttling by receiving a particular service at a lower speed than they expected, but may still have the total speed available for any other service. For example, a client may have a 16Mbps download speed, and require 16Mbps to receive a 1080p stream at 30fps from a movie streaming service. Unfortunately, a large number of other users, although a small percentage of the user base, request the same, which saturates the ISP's link into Level3, forcing redirects to route around, and threaten saturation of the ISP's other link into Hurricane Electric. This saturation event threatens the entire service level of the ISP, and the traffic is singled out as the primary culprit as 4% of the user base are consuming 85% of the bandwidth. The ISP then rate-limits the particular pattern of the stream by hard-limiting the total bandwidth availabe to that traffic across the link to Level3. The streaming player detects the rate-limit that 16Mbps is no longer available, and downgrades the connection from 1080p to 480p @ 30fps, reducing the overall traffic request of the client to 3Mbps. The ISP no longer experiences the link saturation event, but maintains the hard rate-limit to mitigate the risk of a repeat event based on the same traffic.The ISP then contacts the movie streaming service and proposes adding a new peer link to Level3 or providing a caching host connection internal to the ISP's network to avoid repeated saturation issues. Due to the costs of adding the additional peer link on account of a single service overwhelming the ISP's network, the ISP proposes to share the costs of additional infrastructure with the movie streaming service.Netflix and other providers often put servers within an ISP's area so that it reduces the amount of traffic traversing the networks.  So a New York netflix user does not need to cross all the networks between it and Sanfran where the main netflix servers are (hypothetically)
Allegedly some of the ISPs are not allowing the servers within their network to deliberately cause a traffic problem and say it needs to be paid for.So even though Netflix etc don't have servers in the ISPs area they will still have to pay to access the customers. If the netflix server was at the end of your street it would not have to block loads of switches and routers in between. In your example your simplesite.com can currently send unlimited amounts of traffic to anybody and you don't need to pay the ISPs inbetween. They all allow each others traffic to move across the networks. What the ISPs are looking to to is double charge both your website and the customer. Split traffic based on usersYou have three sons in their teens who game like idiots. They use so much bandwidth that you decide to take a second high speed cable connection. You buy a nice Draytek router that can handle two internet connections into one network, and which can decide which computer connects to what network, based on a set of rules. Now you have the following situation: Split traffic based on type of usageSo far nothing new, and this is comparable with two different households, one of them with a fast connection. But now you change the setup of the router, and based on the kind of traffic or the kind of websites that are used, you decide to use ADSL or cable. Given enough users, ADSL will feel ""throttled"". In fact it is not throttled, it's just a slower channel. Given enough speed, cable will never feel throttled. So traffic is not throttled, it's just directed through a channel that cannot handle the speed that you would expect, compared to using cable. Why is this badYou may think that this is not such a bad thing. In my example I'm talking about Facebook and Gmail going through the slow connection. That will not happen. Facebook will pay for speed, just like Google and Microsoft. They have the money. Small firms and sites don't have that money. They will not pay, visitors get annoyed with the slow connection, and stay away. When I google for something like sneakers, I will click several links. Some will take 20-30 seconds to open and before that the page is blank. Many times I close the tab and choose another link. This will get worse. Facebook has its own server farms that serve superfast. I use a cheapass 10 euro a year provider and just one wordpress page can take 30 seconds depending on other traffic on that server. To be honest I still don't see how this is different, and I don't know what the side effects will be. So I can't tell you why this will be more problematic than using (and paying for) a fast or slow server.

"""Slovenia ranks high when it comes to the penetration rate of ultrafast fibre optic cable in homes. It challenged the European Union (EU) data retention directive, as well as the secretly negotiated Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). It went ahead with net neutrality legislation and it is a pioneer in IPv6 deployment, with all major Slovenian mobile providers offering the new internet protocol. So is Slovenia one of those small countries in the EU, where policy innovation takes place?Yes, says the CEO and cofounder of the go6 Institute, Jan Zorz, the national focal point for internet protocol IPv6. Hardly today, responds Bostjan Makarovic of Aphaia, a communications policy consultancy, who has advised the Slovenian government on internet-related policy issues. This article provides a status check on this former republic of the Yugoslav federation.The introduction of IPv6, the new IP protocol, has been put on the official EU policy agenda for some time, but adoption has been slow. While it will allow innovation in the networks, there is a chicken-egg problem for this change. Slovenia leaped ahead in this. A blueprint for IPv6 deployment - the Slovenian move has been called by people such as Martin Levy, Director and IPv6-expert at Hurricane Electric, back in 2012.There where the big operators in larger telecom markets in the EU had a slow start at best, Slovenia leaped ahead. All major Slovenian network operators, plus the three mobile providers Mobitel, Tušmobil und Simobil offered IPv6 connectivity before the IPv6 launch day, in mid-2012, a proud Minister, academic Ziga Turk, announced back then. The national broadcaster, a national search engine and the government itself could be reached over IPv6.While the small size and the just two million population may be an advantage in such a technological migration, Zorz adamantly applauds the way the regulatory authority and the government intervened to bring this about. The regulator APEK, government representatives, telecom operators and stakeholder groups sat together, Zorz recounts. They exchanged information on the transition from the older IP addresses - which were about to run out - to the new, longer version 6 addresses. “When we finished the meeting, everybody went home and did their job and started to push things forward.”The regulator was able do a lot to raise awareness – sending questionnaires about the status quo to operators, content providers and others – and lending credibility to the project, Zorz explains. The government also financially supported free-of-charge training offered to the private sector in Slovenia. Many people, Zorz said, were envious about the cooperative and coordinated process displayed during the IPv6 rollout in Slovenia.Along with the recession kicking in, the budget for training was cut by a new Minister in place. Yet, two things were preserved: the benefits from the early adopter role in IPv6 and an experience in what some call “multi-stakeholder cooperation.” When the notorious 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunication (WCIT-12) came along, public consultations were held nationally and, the voice of stakeholders was heard, Zorz believes.The development of the communications market in this small country, situated between the Alps and the Adria, certainly illustrates that just like their larger sisters in the EU, the small pionieers were affected by the financial crisis. This is best illustrated with the leap of the Slovenian market through the Fibre to the home (FTTH) rollout. In a race between incumbent telecom provider Telekom Slovenije and Vahta (T-2), large cities soon saw two or more broadband options available at their building.The country has reached 39 percent of households passed by optical cables this year, ahead of most large EU countries (only Andorra, Lithuania, Portugal and Latvia have higher rates). Yet, the figure is far from the 100 percent coverage, announced in 2008 according to the FTTH Council Europe, an industry organisation. As soon as the bankruptcy of T-2 , slowed down the challenger, incumbent Telekom Slovenije also stopped “racing.”[1]Meanwhile, Vahta is back on its rollout campaign, challenging its arch-rival Telekom Slovenije with statements saying that rural area Fiber to the Home/Building (FTTX), is possible.
Fiber to the X (FTTX) is a generic term for any broadband network architecture using optical fiber to provide all or part of the local loop used for last mile telecommunications. Source: Wikipedia.“Slovenia used the EU regulatory framework for the late, but successful creation of a competitive telecoms market,” says Makarovic, of Aphaia. “However, Slovenia could currently hardly be seen as avant-garde in communications policy.” Makarovic thinks that there is still a general lack of competitive market-based thinking amongst policy-makers and the delayed privatisation of the incumbent operator “serves as a poor proxy for a comprehensive infrastructure rollout.“Makarovic also deplores that e-commerce has, “despite some brilliant start-ups, largely fallen victim to corporatist mentality and cronyism.” For years, according to recent Slovenian media reports, the sale of state-owned corporations like Telekom Slovenije had been delayed due also to the fact that individuals or groups related to the ruling politicians could be on the losing side (see Reuters). Meanwhile due to Slovenia’s financial crisis, plans for a 100 percent privatisation of the state operator (of which several officials were recently sentenced for bribery) have been confirmed.The work of the well-respected Commission on the prevention of Corruption (CPC) seems to prove that cronyism and corruption is a long neglected problem in the country, with reports on former Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša and other officials being convicted by a Liublijana court for bribery in June 2013.Yet some of the internationally hailed e-commerce start-ups from the country also vanish to reemerge as San Francisco based newcomers with much more investment funds in the bank - see the curious vanishing of Vox.io (a challenger to Gmail calling) and the following start of Layer (a platform to allow easy integration of voice, video and text messages in apps), both co-founded by Slovenian start-up pioneer Tomaž Štolfa. Layer looks like a broader, and especially better funded (1.5 Mio Dollars venture capital) version of Vox.io.  Marakovic is also a sceptic of Slovenia's strict net neutrality law, which puts the country on the list of forerunners for a possible EU solution to internet infrastructure standards. The legislation hailed by supporters as a progressive step is not addressing “real-life issues.“ Instead, Marakovic would like to see the end of a restrictive incumbent bitstream. “Effective wholesale regulation might be more important than net neutrality,” he insists.Considerations by Ziga Turk's successor as Minister of Education, Science and Sport, Jerney Pikolo (in the new government of Slovenia's first female Prime Minister, Alenka Bratušek) about structural separation and a special plan that would provide for Next Generation Access infrastructure would be a “welcome and fresh policy initiative.” Structural separation has been put on the agenda during the recent telecom package renewal in the EU as one rather bold measure to end potential vertical integration.Where does this look at Slovenia's internet and telecommunication policy lead us to? Much more should be said about the cautious reluctance to provide for additional copyright enforcement projects or the complaints that privacy activists have with regard to the lack of debate on biometric passports or intelligence services legislation. Certainly in a country the size of Slovenia, individuals will be relied upon to push pioneer projects – and where this happens, the effect is visible. More pioneers in IT policy will be necessary, if Slovenia is to become an internet policy innovator.[1] The story of T-2 in itself, is singular – as it has been funded by investment company Zvon Ena, a member of Gospodarska Rast Group, a consortium of the Archdiocese of Maribor.The capital city of Slovenia is Ljubljana not Liublijana as you call it!RegardsInternet Policy Review is an open access and peer-reviewed journal on internet regulation.Follow us @POLICYRemailSubscribe NEWSLETTER""",,,
"""How is higher education responding to net neutrality’s impending demise?To answer this question, last week I interviewed the policy director for EDUCAUSE, the largest education and technology group.  The heads of ISTE and the New Media Consortium also published a joint article about their views.   All share a similar stance: that net neutrality is good for education, that the FCC should keep it intact, and educators should advocate for its preservation.I also reached out to Internet2, since they are an academic network.  I was curious about their opinion of the FCC’s decision, as well as how they structured their own system.  Sara Aly, Internet2’s communications manager, kindly answered my barrage of questions.Internet2 supports net neutrality, both for national policy and their own.  They’ve given statements to the FCC to this effect.  They also see their own network as unaffected by Pai’s broader policy change.  Internet2 is also coordinating with EDUCAUSE (recall that they are working with a coalition of organizations and associations).Aly also offered this statement, which I reproduce here in full:Internet2, which owns and operates a national research and education network, has long championed the principle of network openness as fundamental to a free and educated society. This openness has resulted in significant advancements in science, research, and education, and a history of continuous innovation. Internet2 has operated and will continue to operate its network according to open network principles.In particular, Internet2 will not prioritize network traffic or make decisions about content on the network, other than protecting the network and its connectors for security reasons. In addition, our network management practices are widely discussed and disclosed within the research and education community and thus transparency is an essential element of these principles.Regarding the FCC’s Internet Freedom proceeding, Internet2 has been working closely with EDUCAUSE and other higher education associations* who are leading the advocacy efforts on behalf of the research and higher education community. We will continue to support their efforts and provide technical expertise, as necessary. Our primary focus is to make sure that the research and education community participates in a global Internet that offers a level playing field for all innovators.*American Association of Community Colleges (AACC); American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU); American Council on Education (ACE); American Library Association (ALA); Association of American Universities (AAU); Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL); Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU); Association of Research Libraries (ARL); Chief Officers of State Library Agencies (COSLA); Modern Language Association (MLA); and Sacramento Public Library.In short, Internet2 is another educational organization of many that stands against Pai’s new direction.  Unusually, they have the opportunity to practice what they preach.It seems likely that American higher ed stands almost completely united against the end of net neutrality.  It also seems likely the the FCC disagrees and will axe net neutrality in a few days.Where do we go from here?Searching for an article that describes plainly and truthfully my post net neutrality browser experience.I’ve seen many versions.Reblogged this on As the Adjunctiverse Turns.What’s your take on the reality of political censorship under NN?https://dailystormer.red/neutral-apocalypse-the-sky-is-falling-on-ur-tubes/I think it’s likely.

""Net neutrality"" is the term used to describe the concept of keeping the Internet open to all lawful content, information, applications, and equipment. There is increasing concern that the owners of the local broadband connections (usually either the cable or telephone company) may block or discriminate against certain Internet users or applications in order to give an advantage to their own services. While the owners of the local network have a legitimate right to manage traffic on their network to prevent congestion, viruses, and so forth, network owners should not be able to block or degrade traffic based on the identity of the user or the type of application solely to favor their interests.Subscribe to our emails and hear about the latest trends and new resources.""",,,
"""You may have been hearing quite a bit about ânet neutralityâ in recent days. Net Neutrality is the concept behind what is often called the open Internet, which means that all lawful content and providers should be afforded the same level of access. Governments, internet service providers and others would not be allowed to discriminate by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, and modes of communication by providing more robust access to particular companies or applications. Many people consider net neutrality to be a fundamental piece of the Internet architecture.In the United States, the Internet is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Net neutrality is not a new issue. In 2006, Internet2, an organization of world wide leaders in innovation, spoke to the US Senate about this issue: http://www.internet2.edu/vision-initiatives/policy-issues/Net neutrality has been in the headlines in the last few weeks because new rules are being proposed by the FCC in response to a federal court decision that struck down the Open Internet Order in 2010. FCC Chairperson Tom Wheeler outlined his intentions for these new rules in a statement in February 2014: http://www.fcc.gov/document/statement-fcc-chairman-tom-wheeler-fccs-open-internet-rulesRecently, the text of the new rules that will be considered at the May meeting of the FCC began to circulate. While they require a baseline level of service, they also appear to allow Internet Service Providers to provide preferential treatment to some Internet companies. Net neutrality advocates are concerned that these special deals may bar small companies and organizations from being able to compete in an increasingly web-based world thus possibly stifling innovation. In addition, they believe that any limitations on net neutrality could make access more difficult for poor and marginalized populations. Educause, ALA and ARL issued a joint letter to Chairman Wheeler earlier this year addressing their concerns:  http://www.districtdispatch.org/2014/02/ala-arl-educause-re-engage-fcc-network-neutrality/ They are primarily advocating for the FCC to change the classification of broadband to common carrier so it could be subject to requirements related to equitable access .At this time, it is not clear what the impact of these changes might be on schools in terms of both access and cost. The Virginia Society for Technology in Education supports efforts to ensure that the internet remains open as a source of content for schools, students and educators.  We encourage the FCC to evaluate the impact of the net neutrality regulations on schools as part of their upcoming discussions to ensure that students and teachers have access to the fastest, most robust network available at the lowest cost. The FCC has established an inbox for comments related to these new rules, which will be considered on May 15.  Please take some time to review the resources above and provide your comments: http://www.fcc.gov/page/fcc-establishes-new-inbox-open-internet-comments© 2011 Virginia Society for Technology in Education, an official affiliate of the International Society for Technology in Education.   Member Login | Register The presence of advertisements on our website does not indicate endorsement of the products.

 Network Neutrality FAQ Trying to figure out the network neutrality debate via the web is kind of hard. The wikipedia entry is too prone to fights and some of the other web sites are deliberately misleading.  This web site is offered in the hope that it might help introduce matters and points of controversy in network neutrality. More details are found  in the papers on the left. DefinitionNetwork neutrality is best defined as a network design principle.   The idea is that a maximally useful public information network aspires to treat all content, sites, and platforms equally. This allows the network to carry every form of information and support every kind of application.  The principle suggests that information networks are often more valuable when they are less specialized – when they are a platform for multiple uses, present and future. (For people who know more about network design, what is just described is similar to the ""end-to-end"" design principle). (Note that this doesn't suggest every network has to be neutral to be useful. Discriminatory, private networks can be extremely useful for other purposes. What the principle suggests that there is such a thing as a neutral public network, which has a particular value that depends on its neutral nature). A useful way to understand this principle is to look at other networks, like the electric grid, which are implicitly built on a neutrality theory.   The general purpose and neutral nature of the electric grid is one of the things that make it extremely useful.  The electric grid does not care if you plug in a toaster, an iron, or a computer.  Consequently it has survived and supported giant waves of innovation in the appliance market. The electric grid worked for the radios of the 1930s works for the flat screen TVs of the 2000s.   For that reason the electric grid is a model of a neutral, innovation-driving network. The theory behind the network neutrality principle, which the internet sometimes gets close to, is that a neutral network should be expected to deliver the most to a nation and the world economically, by serving as an innovation platform, and socially, by facilitating the widest variety of interactions between people.   The internet isn't perfect but it aspires for neutrality in its original design. Its decentralized and mostly neutral nature may account for its success as an economic engine and a source of folk culture.  Elaborating on this point – what the economic and social benefits of neutral information networks are -- has been one of the aims parts of my scholarship.   In addition, other scholars such as Lawrence Lessig, Mark Lemley, Brett Frischman and Barbara van Schewick, have done much to develop these arguments. The hard question, of course, is what exactly is “neutral?”  But more on that further down.Origins of the Debate The Net Neutrality debate grew out of the concerns in the late 1990s about possible threats to the end-to-end nature of the internet. As documented by Mark Lemley and Lawrence Lessig in particular, the concern was that the vertical integration of cable firms with ISPs would prove a threat to the e2e design of the internet. One suggested remedy was allowing consumers their choice of ISPs, usually called an ""open access remedy."" Another idea was an anti-discrimination rule. This paper, Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination, written in 2002, argued that a discrimination rule was the best way, and in fact better than open access remedies, as a means to protect a neutral network. At some point thereafter the term network neutrality came into common usage. The actual term ""network neutrality,"" new or not, has a lot in common with  alot of old ideas.   The concept of a “common carrier,” dating from 16th century English common law, captures many similar concepts.  A common carrier, in its original meaning, is a private entity that performs a public function (the law was first developed around port authorities).   Furthermore, in networking, the “end-to-end” principle of network design is also a close cousin, if not the direct ancestor of network neutrality.   David Isenberg’s lucid and well known “dumb pipe paper” is more or less the same idea. Moreover, the basic economic problem found in the network neutrality debate (a form of ""platform exclusion"" or ""vertical foreclosure"") can be found in many other markets. In radio, for example, you have the problem of ""payola"" -- payments from the recording industries to radio stations, in exchange for playing their songs. Payola isn't great for music in the United States -- it is one of the reasons radio stations all sound the same.However, I should point out that not all economists think that things like payola are actually a problem. They argue that if payola is inefficient then radio stations that don't accept payments will have an advantage, and would therefore stop, ergo, payola must be welfare maximizing. LawI think it’s important to differentiate sharply between the principle of network neutrality and a network neutrality law.   It’s a mistake to equivocate the design principle with proposed legislation of various forms.  A neutral network might be designed without legal prodding – as in the original internet.   In an ideal world, either competition or enlightened self-interest might drive carriers to design neutral networks.   However, when that isn’t the case—when carriers are interested in discriminating for one of various reasons -- matters get more difficult, and a law may be necessary. To my mind, laws are most successful when they combat harmful behavior. To my mind, the basic justification for any law on network neutrality is an economic justification -- preventing behavior that may be narrowly beneficial for the carrier but that has negative spillovers for the economy and the nation.  The proposals I have supported focus on the following potential problems:1.            Blocking             Blocking is the worst deviation from neutrality. Some economists might think it justified, but the basic problem is a distortion of competition between the blocked and unblocked companies.  2.            Termination Monopoly PricingSince broadband service providers have a ""termination"" monopoly over the end user, they can use that to charge termination fees to those who wish to get access to the user.  3.            “Playing Favorites” or MFN (Most Favored Network?) violations            Where carriers offer exclusive, preferential treatment to one application provider over others. Also distorting, though obviously less than blocking. 4.            Transparency Failures            Where carriers fail to tell customers and application developers what, as far as they know, service they offer – i.e., estimated bandwidth, latency, etc.             In addition, a group have proposed rules on what can be called “Internet” service. Those might be considered a form of transparency regulation.What’s Neutral?              This is the hardest question for any advocate of network neutrality.  I’ve always felt that carriers should be allowed to offer special services on purely private networks.  That’s basically, for example, what the cable TV networks do.             The question then is whether it’s more neutral if carriers build networks with priority for certain content, or whether it’s more neutral to treat a bit as a bit.            I think the best, although still not ideal way to think about this problem is with the help of a private/public distinction.   Private networks in this sense of the word are networks that aren’t interconnected with others.  The cable TV network, described above, is a good example.  On a private network, discrimination part of what gives the network its utility.  By definition it is closed to outsiders, and that’s what makes it useful.   The main point is that discrimination on a private network does have effects on the broader network – it doesn’t spill over.            Matters are different on a public network, or what is sometimes called an inter-network, or internet.  On the internet, discrimination at one point can affect activities on other parts of the network.  Hence             The best design principles leave carriers with a choice: build private networks that are discriminatory by nature (like cable, some versions of IPTV), or join the open network and play by the norms of neutrality.   This is basically the status quo today.            What about the argument that the internet might profitably be improved – that the principles of network neutrality are leaving us with the network of the 1980s?  Shouldn’t people in this field accept that deviations from neutrality might improve the public network, and not just private networks?          This point raises a technical question: for it depends on whether you think Quality of Service guarantees are possible across a large public networks.   Most agree that they work on smaller networks, but how about the entire internet? Among others, the Internet2 research group has argued that QoS systems don't work well on public networks -- Andy Oram has a great piece explaining the development in their thinking.If we assume that QoS generally doesn't work on public networks but does work well on private networks then we reach a common conclusion: the neutrality principle's main exception needs to be for private networks.   It may be better for the entire network's design to distinguish between what's generally public, and what's private, and treat each network differently. Relationship to Market Power            Another hard policy question is whether network neutrality rules (or laws) are called for in the absence of market power and concentration.  As discussed above, network neutrality is first and foremost a principle.   Therefore, in a market where vigorous competition exists, will the market itself solve any problems of discrimination?            I don’t want to try and answer the question on this web page – I address it more fully in my writings at left.   But suffice to say, whether neutrality rules might still be useful given vigorous competition is an open question.  ConclusionThis short page can only introduce the concept of network neutrality and flesh out a few ideas.

"""Derived From: 12/23/10 FCC Acts to Preserve Internet Freedom and Openness. R&O: Word  | Acrobat  Executive SummaryToday the Commission takes an important step to preserve the Internet as an open platform for innovation, investment, job creation, economic growth, competition, and free expression. To provide greater clarity and certainty regarding the continued freedom and openness of the Internet, we adopt three basic rules that are grounded in broadly accepted Internet norms, as well as our own prior decisions: We believe these rules, applied with the complementary principle of reasonable network management, will empower and protect consumers and innovators while helping ensure that the Internet continues to flourish, with robust private investment and rapid innovation at both the core and the edge of the network. This is consistent with the National Broadband Plan goal of broadband access that is ubiquitous and fast, promoting the global competitiveness of the United States. [Plan  at xi, 3-5] Just over a year ago, we launched a public process to determine whether and what actions might be necessary to preserve the characteristics that have allowed the Internet to grow into an indispensable platform supporting our nation's economy and civic life, and to foster continued investment in the physical networks that enable the Internet. Since then, more than 100,000 commenters have provided written input. Commission staff held several public workshops and convened a Technological Advisory Process with experts from industry, academia, and consumer advocacy groups to collect their views regarding key technical issues related to Internet openness. This process has made clear that the Internet has thrived because of its freedom and openness-the absence of any gatekeeper blocking lawful uses of the network or picking winners and losers online. Consumers and innovators do not have to seek permission before they use the Internet to launch new technologies, start businesses, connect with friends, or share their views. The Internet is a level playing field. Consumers can make their own choices about what applications and services to use and are free to decide what content they want to access, create, or share with others. This openness promotes competition. It also enables a self-reinforcing cycle of investment and innovation in which new uses of the network lead to increased adoption of broadband, which drives investment and improvements in the network itself, which in turn lead to further innovative uses of the network and further investment in content, applications, services, and devices. A core goal of this Order is to foster and accelerate this cycle of investment and innovation. The record and our economic analysis demonstrate, however, that the openness of the Internet cannot be taken for granted, and that it faces real threats. Indeed, we have seen broadband providers endanger the Internet's openness by blocking or degrading content and applications without disclosing their practices to end users and edge providers, notwithstanding the Commission's adoption of open Internet principles in 2005. In light of these considerations, as well as the limited choices most consumers have for broadband service, broadband providers' financial interests in telephony and pay television services that may compete with online content and services, and the economic and civic benefits of maintaining an open and competitive platform for innovation and communication, the Commission has long recognized that certain basic standards for broadband provider conduct are necessary to ensure the Internet's continued openness. The record also establishes the widespread benefits of providing greater clarity in this area-clarity that the Internet's openness will continue, that there is a forum and procedure for resolving alleged open Internet violations, and that broadband providers may reasonably manage their networks and innovate with respect to network technologies and business models. We expect the costs of compliance with our prophylactic rules to be small, as they incorporate longstanding openness principles that are generally in line with current practices and with norms endorsed by many broadband providers. Conversely, the harms of open Internet violations may be substantial, costly, and in some cases potentially irreversible. The rules we proposed in the Open Internet NPRM and those we adopt today follow directly from the Commission's bipartisan Internet Policy Statement, adopted unanimously in 2005 and made temporarily enforceable for certain broadband providers in 2005 [AT&T/SBC] [Verizon/MCI] and 2007 [AT&T / BS]; openness protections the Commission established in 2007 for users of certain wireless spectrum; and a notice of inquiry in 2007 that asked, among other things, whether the Commission should add a principle of nondiscrimination to the Internet Policy Statement. Our rules build upon these actions, first and foremost by requiring broadband providers to be transparent in their network management practices, so that end users can make informed choices and innovators can develop, market, and maintain Internet-based offerings. The rules also prevent certain forms of blocking and discrimination with respect to content, applications, services, and devices that depend on or connect to the Internet. An open, robust, and well-functioning Internet requires that broadband providers have the flexibility to reasonably manage their networks. Network management practices are reasonable if they are appropriate and tailored to achieving a legitimate network management purpose. Transparency and end-user control are touchstones of reasonableness. We recognize that broadband providers may offer other services over the same last-mile connections used to provide broadband service. These ""specialized services"" can benefit end users and spur investment, but they may also present risks to the open Internet. We will closely monitor specialized services and their effects on broadband service to ensure, through all available mechanisms, that they supplement but do not supplant the open Internet. Mobile broadband is at an earlier stage in its development than fixed broadband and is evolving rapidly. For that and other reasons discussed below, we conclude that it is appropriate at this time to take measured steps in this area. Accordingly, we require mobile broadband providers to comply with the transparency rule, which includes enforceable disclosure obligations regarding device and application certification and approval processes; we prohibit providers from blocking lawful websites; and we prohibit providers from blocking applications that compete with providers' voice and video telephony services. We will closely monitor the development of the mobile broadband market and will adjust the framework we adopt today as appropriate. These rules are within our jurisdiction over interstate and foreign communications by wire and radio. Further, they implement specific statutory mandates in the Communications Act (""Act"") and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (""1996 Act""), including provisions that direct the Commission to promote Internet investment and to protect and promote voice, video, and audio communications services.                            The framework we adopt aims to ensure the Internet remains an open platform- one characterized by free markets and free speech- that enables consumer choice, end-user control, competition through low barriers to entry, and the freedom to innovate without permission . The framework does so by protecting openness through high-level rules, while maintaining broadband providers' and the Commission's flexibility to adapt to changes in the market and in technology as the Internet continues to evolve.. . . . . 44. We find that open Internet rules should apply to ""broadband Internet access service,"" which we define as: A mass-market retail service by wire or radio that provides the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints, including any capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the communications service, but excluding dial-up Internet access service. This term also encompasses any service that the Commission finds to be providing a functional equivalent of the service described in the previous sentence, or that is used to evade the protections set forth in this Part. The term ""broadband Internet access service"" includes services provided over any technology platform, including but not limited to wire, terrestrial wireless (including fixed and mobile wireless services using licensed or unlicensed spectrum), and satellite. [145] 45. ""Mass market"" means a service marketed and sold on a standardized basis to residential customers, small businesses, and other end-user customers such as schools and libraries. [146] For purposes of this definition, ""mass market"" also includes broadband Internet access services purchased with the support of the E-rate program that may be customized or individually negotiated. The term does not include enterprise service offerings, which are typically offered to larger organizations through customized or individually negotiated arrangements. [147]46. ""Broadband Internet access service"" encompasses services that ""provide the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints."" To ensure the efficacy of our rules in this dynamic market, we also treat as a ""broadband Internet access service"" any service the Commission finds to be providing a functional equivalent of the service described in the previous sentence, or that is used to evade the protections set forth in these rules. 47. A key factor in determining whether a service is used to evade the scope of the rules is whether the service is used as a substitute for broadband Internet access service. For example, an Internet access service that provides access to a substantial subset of Internet endpoints based on end users preference to avoid certain content, applications, or services; [148]  Internet access services that allow some uses of the Internet (such as access to the World Wide Web) but not others (such as e-mail); or a ""Best of the Web"" Internet access service that provides access to 100 top websites could not be used to evade the open Internet rules applicable to ""broadband Internet access service."" Moreover, a broadband provider may not evade these rules simply by blocking end users' access to some Internet endpoints. Broadband Internet access service likely does not include services offering connectivity to one or a small number of Internet endpoints for a particular device, e.g. , connectivity bundled with e-readers, heart monitors, or energy consumption sensors, to the extent the service relates to the functionality of the device. [149] Nor does broadband Internet access service include virtual private network services, content delivery network services, multichannel video programming services, hosting or data storage services, or Internet backbone services (if those services are separate from broadband Internet access service). These services typically are not mass market services and/or do not provide the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints. [150]But see 2014 Open Internet NPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 5582, para. 59 (asking whether OI should apply to backbones and Internet traffic exchange)48. Although one purpose of our open Internet rules is to prevent blocking or unreasonable discrimination in transmitting online traffic for applications and services that compete with traditional voice and video services, we determine that open Internet rules applicable to fixed broadband providers should protect all types of Internet traffic, not just voice or video Internet traffic.  This reflects, among other things, our view that it is generally preferable to neither require nor encourage broadband providers to examine Internet traffic in order to discern which traffic is subject to the rules. Even if we were to limit our rules to voice or video traffic, moreover, it is unlikely that broadband providers could reliably identify such traffic in all circumstances, particularly if the voice or video traffic originated from new services using uncommon protocols. [151] Indeed, limiting our rules to voice and video traffic alone could spark a costly and wasteful cat-and-mouse game in which edge providers and end users seeking to obtain the protection of our rules could disguise their traffic as protected communications. [152]49.  We recognize that there is one Internet (although it is comprised of a multitude of different networks), and that it should remain open and interconnected regardless of the technologies and services end users rely on to access it. However, for reasons discussed in Part III.E below related to mobile broadband-including the fact that it is at an earlier stage and more rapidly evolving-we apply open Internet rules somewhat differently to mobile broadband than to fixed broadband at this time. We define ""fixed broadband Internet access service"" as a broadband Internet access service that serves end users primarily at fixed endpoints using stationary equipment, such as the modem that connects an end user's home router, computer, or other Internet access device to the network. This term encompasses fixed wireless broadband services (including services using unlicensed spectrum) and fixed satellite broadband services. We define ""mobile broadband Internet access service"" as a broadband Internet access service that serves end users primarily using mobile stations. [47 U.S.C. § 153(34) (""The term 'mobile station' means a radio-communication station capable of being moved and which ordinarily does move."")] Mobile broadband Internet access includes services that use smartphones as the primary endpoints for connection to the Internet. [We note that Section 337(f)(1) of the Act excludes public safety services from the definition of mobile broadband Internet access service.] The discussion in this Part applies to both fixed and mobile broadband, unless specifically noted. Part III.E further discusses application of open Internet rules to mobile broadband. 50.  For a number of reasons, these rules apply only to the provision of broadband Internet access service and not to edge provider activities, such as the provision of content or applications over the Internet. [155] First, the Communications Act particularly directs us to prevent harms related to the utilization of networks and spectrum to provide communication by wire and radio. [156
                              
                              
                            See  47 U.S.C. § 151] Second, these rules are an outgrowth of the Commission's Internet Policy Statement . [157] The Statement  was issued in 2005 when the Commission removed key regulatory protections from DSL service, and was intended to protect against the harms to the open Internet that might result from broadband providers' subsequent conduct. [158] The Commission has always understood those principles to apply to broadband Internet access service only, as have most private-sector stakeholders. [159] Thus, insofar as these rules translate existing Commission principles into codified rules, it is appropriate to limit the application of the rules to broadband Internet access service. Third, broadband providers control access to the Internet for their subscribers and for anyone wishing to reach those subscribers. [160] They are therefore capable of blocking, degrading, or favoring any Internet traffic that flows to or from a particular subscriber. 51.  We also do not apply these rules to dial-up Internet access service because telephone service has historically provided the easy ability to switch among competing dial-up Internet access services. Moreover, the underlying dial-up Internet access service is subject to protections under Title II of the Communications Act. The Commission's interpretation of those protections has resulted in a market for dial-up Internet access that does not present the same concerns as the market for broadband Internet access. [161] No commenters suggested extending open Internet rules to dial-up Internet access service. 52. Finally, we decline to apply our rules directly to coffee shops, bookstores, airlines, and other entities when they acquire Internet service from a broadband provider to enable their patrons to access the Internet from their establishments (we refer to these entities as ""premise operators""). [162] These services are typically offered by the premise operator as an ancillary benefit to patrons. However, to protect end users, we include within our rules broadband Internet access services provided to premise operators for purposes of making service available to their patrons. [163] Although broadband providers that offer such services are subject to open Internet rules, we note that addressing traffic unwanted by a premise operator is a legitimate network management purpose.

It seeks to do so in a manner that will promote and protect the legitimate needs of consumers, broadband Internet access service providers, entrepreneurs, investors, and businesses of all sizes that make use of the Internet.The Commission has addressed openness issues in a variety of contexts and proceedings, including: a unanimous policy statement in 2005 , a notice of inquiry on broadband industry practices in 2007 , public comment on several petitions for rulemaking , conditions associated with significant communications industry mergers, the rules for the 700 MHz spectrum auction in 2007 , specific enforcement actions, and public en banc hearings. During this time period, opportunities for public participation have generated over 100,000 pages of input in approximately 40,000 filings from interested parties and members of the public.The process today's Notice initiates will build upon the existing record at the Commission to identify the best means to achieve the goal of preserving and promoting the open Internet.Recognizing that the proposed framework needs to balance potentially competing interests while helping to ensure an open, safe, and secure Internet, the draft rules would permit broadband Internet access service providers to engage in reasonable network management, including but not limited to reasonable practices to reduce or mitigate the effects of network congestion.Under the draft proposed rules, subject to reasonable network management, a provider of broadband Internet access service: 

                            The draft rules make clear that providers would also be permitted to address harmful traffic and traffic unwanted by users, such as spam, and prevent both the transfer of unlawful content, such as child pornography, and the unlawful transfer of content, such as a transfer that would infringe copyright. Further, nothing in the draft rules supersedes any obligation a broadband Internet access service provider may have -- or limits its ability -- to deliver emergency communications, or to address the needs of law enforcement, public safety, or national or  security authorities, consistent with applicable law.The Commission is also seeking comment on how it should address ""managed"" or ""specialized"" services, which are Internet-Protocol-based offerings provided over the same networks used for broadband Internet access services. While the proceeding will seek input on how best to define and treat such services, managed services could include voice, video, and enterprise business services, or specialized applications like telemedicine, smart grid, or eLearning offerings. These services may provide consumer benefits and lead to increased deployment of broadband networks.The Notice asks how the Commission should define the category of managed or specialized services, what policies should apply to them, and how to ensure that broadband providers' ability to innovate, develop valuable new services, and experiment with new technologies and business models can co-exist with the preservation of the free and open Internet on which consumers and businesses of all sizes depend.The Notice affirms that the six principles it proposes to codify would apply to all platforms for broadband Internet access, including mobile wireless broadband, while recognizing that different access platforms involve significantly different technologies, market structures, patterns of consumer usage, and regulatory history. To that end, the Notice seeks comment on how, in what time frames or phases, and to what extent the principles should apply to non-wireline forms of broadband Internet access, including mobile wireless.Recognizing that the Commission's decisions in this rulemaking must reflect a thorough understanding of current technology and future technological trends, the Chief of the Commission's Office of Engineering & Technology will create an inclusive, open, and transparent process for obtaining the best technical advice and information from a broad range of engineers. The adoption of this Notice will open a window for submitting comments to the FCC. Comments can be filed through the Commission's Electronic Comment Filing System, and are due on Thursday, January 14. Reply comments are due on Friday, March 5. In addition, the rulemaking process will include many other avenues for public input, including open workshops on key issues; providing feedback through openinternet.gov, which will include regular blog posts by Commission staff; and other new media tools, including IdeaScale, an online platform for brainstorming and rating solutions to policy challenges.Action by the Commission, October 22, 2009, by Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FCC 09-93).

The Fine Print: The following comments are owned by whoever posted them.  We are not responsible for them in any way.
however, the big issue is the connection to our old friend, The Connected Internet. if you don't live next to a peering point, you are going to have to backhaul to it, or hook to another Tier 1 or 2 provider who is.  money, money, money.  lighting the glass is not free, either.pipe dream.300â per month for gigabit port in some peering points. Of course you still need to peer with other networks and you will need transit (at least until you reach tier-1 status ;) ) but competition at most exchanges is much bigger for transit so you can get an ok deal. Fiber backhaul is very expensive if you need to lease private dark fiber (but around here you also have some that is publicly owned and cheaper), microwave links do not need to be, depending on the situation. Roof access at the datacenter Also, unless there are massive advances in satellite internet (which there very well could be), the reliance upon massive corporations who own backbones will always be there holding us back.We need advanced technology to free us but the problem is that R&D projects are always going to be hamstrung by lobbyists and big corps.The other big issue here is student debt, tbh. Take any PHD and unless they sell their soul to big corps, they are penniless. It reminds me of guys like Tesla, who despite all of his advancements for human technology, died alone and completely depressed and broke.If we could eradicate reliance upon educational institutions for furthering human knowledge, we could then start seeing more and more open source solutions to big problems.AI is going to somewhat solve this problem. The AI arms race will be all about computing power. As quantum computers advance and become more accessible, an average person will eventually be able to do way more than they could today, including research and also personal protection, on the same level as large corporations or governments. But even then, we have the problem that everything we use for computing is sourced by massive corporations. Sure, eventually 3d printing will make home computer construction a possibility, but that's a long ways away.If the world starts embracing a fair universal income standard, we could also see huge advancements happening from basements and garages at a much higher rate than today but still these efforts will face roadblocks designed by massive companies like MSFT and Apple who prefer to keep us in the dark about most of their design and getting worse every day for selfishness.Today? Students are caught within the politics of old boys networks. That also is a huge obstacle. That said, most of these kinds of problems could potentially change dramatically as we further deplete our natural resources and our governments continue to be terrible examples of human beings.But if you look at Health Care, for example, in many countries where a proper health care standard exists where people aren't bankrupted by hospital bills, that is always a public service and never is there a case supporting 3rd party health care where citizens are better off short term or long term.I guess if there was a state security element to health care, we might see worse results with a public health care system, but overall the private healthcare systems are just terribly corrupt.The average person today has way more computing power in their cell phone than any government or corporation several decades ago - it hasn't changed the balance of power because governments and corporations *also*  have radically increased their computing power, so it still dwarfs that controlled by individuals.  AI capable of solving endemic social problems is unlikely to help much, because the people profiting from those problems will have their own, far more powerful AIs dedicated to improving their profits.  The result being that not only would the profiteers be more powerful than the disordered masses, as they are today, they'd also have radically more powerful intelligence at their disposal than the masses.The average person today has way more computing power in their cell phone than any government or corporation several decades ago - it hasn't changed the balance of power because governments and corporations *also* have radically increased their computing power, so it still dwarfs that controlled by individuals.You're right. However, my more nuanced point that possibly wasn't explained well enough is that we need to start actively thwarting that stranglehold. Individualism is good to a point. Collectivism is Is Tesla doing anything to fight corruption?  I must have missed that press release.  They're doing an end-run around corrupt regulations in order to do business, maybe even fighting those specific regulations that interfere with their profits, but that's hardly the same thing as ""good"".But if you look at Health Care, for example, in many countries where a proper health care standard exists where people aren't bankrupted by hospital bills, that is always a public service and never is there a case supporting 3rd party health care where citizens are better off short term or long term.Are you under the impression that there is no 3rd-party private healthcare option in places where there is a national health service, like in Canada or the UK? You may want to take another look at the situation... Bespoke healthcare is fairly common in the UK, and countless Canadians cross the border into the US for their medical needs.But if you look at Health Care, for example, in many countries where a proper health care standard exists where people aren't bankrupted by hospital bills, that is always a public service and never is there a case supporting 3rd party health care where citizens are better off short term or long term.Are you under the impression that there is no 3rd-party private healthcare option in places where there is a national health service, like in Canada or the UK?

So, no.  Not a replacement for logic.  More like a slaver of.""Massive advances in satellite internet""Yes, all you need to do is repeal the laws of physics.  Simple.Indeed.

If there's a publicly available fiber backbone, I'm not aware of it.Call me a cynic, but I think there are other flaws as well.For one thing, it seems fairly obvious to me that moving from a national+state-government-regulated Internet to a local-government-regulated Internet is just creating many opportunities for problems where before we had, nominally, ""only"" 51.And that's not to say that the feds, and the states, wouldn't step in and regulate from afar either; after all, There's a the flaw in this plan.

They'll likely pass rules to prevent any such 'people's internet revolution(TM)'.No, the only way I see for taking back control is to either remove government regulation of the internet or to reduce the size, power, and scope of the government overall.As long as Big Government and it's inherent corruption and cronyism controls it, it will not be operated in the best There's a the flaw in this plan.

I'm gonna go build my own internet infrastructure, with blackjack and hookers.In fact, forget the internet thing!I believe the subject of the article was written as a bet to see how long it would take for the first reference about blackjack and hookers to be posted.I hear they have those those things on the internet now.Me too. I'm a bit sad to see it took four first-level posts to get to it.I'd be interested to see how these ""communities"" manage to afford to lay their own billion dollar T1 backbone infrastructure. Good luck rattling the tin for the funds for that! You might as well say people who are fed up with traffic laws should built their own highways - a dose of realism is needed here people. Infrastructure is NOT cheap.But it's getting cheaper, and that's the point.We're entering an era where reliable, unlicensed frequency gigabit radios are small thousands to buy and install. Buried fibre may still be the most reliable option, but for residential and SOHO internet this is generally ""good enough"" and easily comparable to uptimes for Cable/DSL/GPON. That puts cost recovery on a small investment + monthly internet within 2 years for most projects.
Those uptimes will depend on range and weather. I'd parallel in a lower frequency/bandwidth backup.This reminds me a lot about what we're currently seeing happening with the Rust programming language. It's following a very similar path, and I think the outcome could be the same in the end.So there's the incumbent. In the case of Rust, the incumbent is C++. It has been entrenched for decades, and has become very successful.Then we have these Rust upstarts come along, who want to do things their own way. It's not necessarily the case that they can do any better; they're more interested in just being differ They could just use leased lines, VPN tunnels, and wifi.   You build some free network in one downtown community with boring free public-access quality content.  It costs nothing to run that, then you link a few of these community hotspots together with VPN and suddenly you have a network.   Cost of putting content on the network?  Maybe very low, there are lots of peer to peer technologies that could develop into free CDN like services.  Maybe you connect and the captive portal offers up some browser plugi The technology available to ordinary people is not long-range. You get a hundred meters with regular APs, and a few kilometers line-of-sight wireless with directional antennas - but you can't go around stringing fiber up all over a city, or burying it alongside roads.I'd love to try what you are doing. Seriously, I would. It sounds like a fun challenge and a satisfying project. But for that to be viable I'd need a very high density of local nerds with the inclination and ability to join me. Very few places Hahah I'm not even trying to do it sadly but I did spend a little bit of time daydreaming about the feasibility and details since making that post.I was one of the first users on TOR and a relatively early internet adopter so I know what infant networks look like compared to what they look like once they're in the mainstream.All we would need to do is configure one of those dual SSID wifi networks with an open guest side, prioritize the AP owner's private side over the open guest side.  Have it connect to t First thing, forget Freenet. Nice idea, great at what it does, but not what we want - that extreme level of counter-monitoring has a serious performance hit. Also it's storage architecture is seriously inelegant, and that's not fixable - it makes block management unweildy. I suggest IPFS instead. If you want to do what you propose, IPFS may be the key to viability.AP + captive portal with instructions + IPFS node with generous cache tied across the internet. That'll get you everything except real-time commu Wow that IPFS is exactly the sort of problem we would need to solve eventually,  But just getting a wan set up and exposed to small parts of the world over wifi would be step one.  As I said you can't do that forever but you could surely run like that until you'd attracted nerd talent and tech resources to move to the next phase.But for that to be viable I'd need a very high density of local nerds with the inclination and ability to join me. Very few places meet these criteria.Seattle, San Francisco, Austin, College campuses (especially dorms!)I guess if you really want to set it up keep talking to me and respect that I am extremely lazy.

Funny they don't even see the problem there.Actually, that part's kinda reasonable. Sort of the Doctrine of the Lesser Magistrate [wikipedia.org].Who's trying to save the internet from the Government? The concern here is that the Government is removing regulation that keeps the monopolistic communication companies from ruining the internet. The regulation was good and worked to keep the internet healthy. The problem here isn't government control, it is corporate lackeys placed into influential government positions specifically to remove regulatory hurdles for the corporations.And, I'd note that the government intervention was only needed because of the greed of the big ISPs. Before Net Neutrality was a government regulation, it was the unwritten law of the land. If you ran an ISP, you treated two video packets the same regardless if one came from Netflix and the other came from some tiny, obscure site.Then, the big ISPs saw the Internet companies making a ton of money and got greedy. They wanted some of that and decided to get it, not by innovating, but by charging on both ends. I don't see how bottom up is far too expensive or complicated for large national corporations (with deep pockets) but is going to help some small grassroots effort to build another internet.  As far as I can tell, the large companies can keep the local municipalities in line by threatening not to move into the area.The difference is bottom up local government, where comcast and others have to subvert thousands of municipalitiesRight, because there's no way a Comcast or Verizon could subvert thousands of municipalities.You understand that before you were likely born Verizon, Comcast, and dozens of other cable companies and telcos got their local monopolies willingly given to them by ""thousands of municipalities""...The difference is bottom up local government, where comcast and others have to subvert thousands of municipalitiesRight, because there's no way a Comcast or Verizon could subvert thousands of municipalities.You understand that before you were likely born Verizon, Comcast, and dozens of other cable companies and telcos got their local monopolies willingly given to them by ""thousands of municipalities""...we must end our reliance on big telecom monopolies and build decentralized, affordable, locally owned internet infrastructure.

Get out of the way so the adults can make your life better.I think that the existing state of the internet infrastructure has been deemed too big to fail, and that anything that threatens its stability will not be treated kindly.  When ILECs started struggling during competition with CLECs as the first tech bubble came apart, the mandated leasing of line stuff to the CLECs was terminated, and I don't see anything heading in that direction at all after things stabilized.  They want the big players to stay healthy.The internet is constantly changing.The whole situation sucks.

We need someone who can afford to run the infrastructure to join the battle. Google started the push to encrypt everywhere, which is half there. Maybe we can get them to take the fight to the next level.Because what you are now motivated to do, was the only robust solution anyway. Market pain beats political bootlicking. Don't beg for what you want, build it. If you get it big enough to matter they folks in charge will just buy it out.
Rinse, repeat. They're broke and not in charge anymore...halfwit.What happened to Internet2?

You telling me that 2 years isn't long enough for the internet to change?  Remember when bit torrent wasn't a thing?  So do I.  Heck I even remember when ISPs began having fits because quake was taking up huge chunks of their local bandwidth.  Had traffic shaping tech been available back then, I am pretty sure they would have been turning off apps left and right.  It's only fairly recently that networks have started seriously shaping and limiting their bandwidth.You call me bad nerd and then say we didn't have traffic shaping circa the Quake era ?I was working at a ISP circa 1998-2002.  We did have traffic shaping tech back then.  We did use it.  It did screw our users.  We stopped because it was screwing our users and wasn't in the best interest of the company and basically hurt the service and thus our corporate image.Maybe you're just not old enough to remember this stuff ?  The point is not that the FCC Title II rules are from 2015, it's that they are way too c I really curious what appliance you were using way back in 1998, when most of the RFCs for traffic shaping were just coming out?  I myself worked for 2 isps, one Dial-up based from 98 to 2000, with about 30,000 subscribers, and then another from 2000 to 2005 (250,000 adsl subscribers at the end of my stint) and while it is possible we were just some backwoods ISP, I don't remember shaping appliances being a real option until at LEAST 2003.  Sure, you could throttle the connection, but there was nothing near I'm saying *SIMPLER* rules, as pointed out by Micheal Orielly in his dissent to Title II, would be serve the users, and actually be what we've been asking for since day 1.Title II was an abomination of government overreach and bureaucracy gone wrong.Internet 2 has existed for 20 years or so but it's only available to government and universities.Internet 3 needs to be a independent mesh network with zero dependency on government or corporations in order to prevent any of them from getting control.it needs to have no dependency on DNS, DHCP or any registration service which means IPv6 or some other protocol.Start by hosting your own stuff, and running a cable to your neighbors, or by using a radio router or laser router or packet radio to network all ove It's electing people who are committed to CITIZEN'S INTERESTS to Congress.  They can actively appoint qualified, and public-interest-minded heads of departments, like the FCC.During Obama's presidency, we had Tom Wheeler, who ruled (almost universally) in favor of citizens' interests...and, in fact, established the ""Net Neutrality"" rules in 2015...against the wishes of one of his Commission members, Ajit Pai.  When Wheeler retired, Ajit Pai (who is a legal shill who worked at Verizon, who benefits from his decisions) ascended to the Chairman post, and started dismantling the good work done by Mr. Wheeler...mostly (I posit) because he wants that job back at Verizon, when he is replaced in the future.The Republicans are notoriously favorable to providing more advantages to large corporations (e.g., Verizon) and couldn't care less about you and me.  With the Buffoon in the White House, and a Republican dominated Congress, we can expect virtually every government-sponsored benefit to citizens to be abolished or diminished.So, to my mind the ONLY ONE SOLUTION is to restore our government to attending to benefits for citizens...it's not going to be done by a party that passes legislation to give Fat Cats tax breaks, and make you and I pay MORE taxes to cover the giveaway.  Have YOU figured out the solution yet?  It's a plain as the nose on your face!  Make sure that we elect people who CARE about the citizens' interests, not just lining their own pockets.  They will do the work of replacing the people who are engaged in wholesale destruction of every potential good for citizens.  I reason that there is NO REASON our country should be favoring large businesses over individual citizens.  Others' may believe differently.You change the background of you Facebook photo. That is how we prostest now.
Net neutrality might be won back with Blue Team temporarily, but only because it benefits the position of two of the largest internet platforms that are fancying themselves as arbiters of acceptable political speech and news for the masses. Anything good for the public will come as an unintentional byproduct of serving their own interests.

It's rinse and repeat in an endless cycle where one side that fucks us over to the point where voters get pissed and toss them out in favor of the other side that fucks Before going directly for the last-resort option, maybe try to keep that no-good Verizon goon from rolling back net neutrality? I think the mother of all protests is in order. Think SOPA blackout protest times a hundred. Give that a try and see how it goes.I've said this multiple times on slashdot, but in my experience, the best option is to resolve this issue at the County/PUD level. My favourite example is what is available in Chelan and Douglas counties, in Eastern Washington state. In both of these counties, the PUDs have built out nearly ubiquitous FTTH networks.The trick is that the PUDs only provide the last mile service, they don't provide the content (in the case of TV) or Internet service. When a local resident wants to sign up, they have the choice of some 8 or 9 ISPs, and 6+ TV providers, all of whom in turn transport that service over the County network. Businesses can also buy transport from Zayo, Cogent, and some other peering provider. For the resident, it's easy... Their bill for TV or Internet (or both), has something like a $6/mo line access charge which covers the fiber connection, and the rest is for service. On the flip side, the service provider doesn't need to maintain the last mile.The PUDs themselves are responsible to their residents through elections, and from my observation are very responsive to faults in their systems. I was involved in the summer of 2015 when a wildfire burned through and knocked out a significant chunk of their infrastructure, both power and fiber. They had the fiber truck rolling right behind the power trucks, and had the system back up and running as soon as they could source and plant 50+ replacement power poles.This kind of thing really does work.I've said this multiple times on slashdot, but in my experience, the best option is to resolve this issue at the County/PUD leveThey know [slashdot.org]. Somebody was listening to you.What a fantastic idea! All he is proposing is entering a regulated business (becoming your own ""Internet Service Provider""), and simply ignoring the existing regulations! It's amazing how many brilliant ideas these Internet Wunder-kind come up with that have as a basic part of their business plan the simple disregard/ignoring of any applicable regulation.So the plan is to exploit a non-existent ""public backbone"", erect your own wireless towers and maybe even lay cable along the right-of-way? I can't imagine I didn't say ""no technical solution"", my issue was the existing regulations that he just decided don't apply, freeing this ""new"" internet from the legal shackles of regulations.The linked-to article is talking about paralleling the existing physical plant owned by big ISPs with an alternate plant constructed of the same/similar technology owned by municipalities.I don't understand how it is that a Comcast or Verizon-like company, classified as an ISP is subject to federal regulation, but somehow when your t Trump voters did this. And worse.Please, rethink your politics. This is just the beginning of the train wreck.So the FCC, up until a couple years ago had no ""net neutrality"" regulations, then they implemented some regulations, that the FCC is now considering rolling those ""net neutrality"" regulations back, and the best answer it to create your own unregulated internet as an alternative to the soon-to-be unregulated internet?In cities where the density of privately owned computers is high enough, it would be technically feasible to use mesh networks for most of the local traffic. You scratch my back, I forward your packets and provide local caching services for viral content. Something along those lines. Still need some gateways to long-distance networks, but most of the infrastructure doesn't need to be owned by giant cancerous corporations. Let's not forget soulless and driven by nothing but profit maximization. (Ranting now, You'd also need to use some sort of content addressed distributed store to make bulk traffic manageable. I see some potential in IPFS. If you take the distributed store from that, and combine it with mesh networking, then... well, it's still not entirely workable. But it's an avenue to explore.I feel like I failed to be sufficiently clear, though I think I agree with your comment. Technology remains morally neutral. Technology can be used to increase freedom or destroy it. Highly centralized networks of the corporations, with rules by the lawyers, for the greater wealth of the richest 0.1% are NOT going to increase your (or my) freedom. It's not a struggle between capitalism and socialism. Dead concepts. What we have here is corporate cancerism running amok.My alternative vision from more than 30 With proper power management and a butterfly network type of design, bandwidth can increase with the ln of the number of nodes.  Much better than uniformly.  The problem is your latency becomes abysmal as your number of nodes increases.  In a circular city of 200,000 you will have 80 to 250 hops to transit that city.  Using cheap CPU based routing you will introduce seconds of latency.  You won't care if you are watching a movie and have a decent buffer, but Skype will be very clunky, game play impossible.One way to lessen the latency is have several different gateways out to the internet at large. Maybe if you had 1 dedicated gateway for each class C network, it might help.With proper power management and a butterfly network type of design, bandwidth can increase with the ln of the number of nodes.

It looks like Big Telecom is going to get its way and we will be paying even more and getting substantially less. Soon we'll have to pay a base price of around 50.00. Then add 5.00 extra for streaming, 5.00 extra for HD streaming, 5.00 for social network access, and so on and so forth.With the abundance of commodity hardware, open source software, and the relative ease of wireless deployments, it is easier to do > Then add 5.00 extra for streaming, 5.00 extra for HD streaming, 5.00 for social network access, and so on and so forth.Actually, tiered pricing based on QoS and bandwidth would be fine (assuming reasonable competition in the ISP market).   It's tiered pricing for access to particular sources (or, worse, network access billing on the server side) of data that's bad.Imagine if it was impossible to start a new Netflix because you can't start a company with enough capital to pay the major ISPs' fees for st People talk about decentralized, P2P networks but don't understand that current versions (FreeNet, I2P, IPFS, ZeroNet, etc.) are not true P2P.  Peers connect to the Internet via ISP, which are part of a collection of star networks.  Peers act as hosts or ""service"" providers when they make connections to several hundred peers and host a copy of their websites on a local HD.  Many ISP's ToS forbid such activity.  Some ISP's block P2P connections, considering them to be torrents used for illegal activity.A tru Some of those - Freenet and IPFS at least, I don't know enough about the others to say - are capable of operating in an almost fully distributed manner using only short-range wifi mesh. But that won't work right now because there isn't enough user density. The chances of you having another person living within a hundred-meter range of your home who also runs Freenet or IPFS are rather remote.the fight continues at the local level in Colorado for energy and data local autonomy from terrible corporations: https://muninetworks.org/conte...

"""Thanks for being here, come back soon. Get notified of new posts:Subscription confirmed. Thank you for subscribing!Loading...February 27, 2015 12:14AMToday the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to extend the rules that previously regulated the telephone industry to now regulate Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Commission did this in order to preserve the principle of network neutrality. Broadly stated, this principle is that networks should not discriminate against content that passes through them.At CloudFlare, we are strong proponents of network neutrality. My co-founder, Michelle Zatlyn, sat on the FCC's Open Internet Advisory Committee. The work of that committee played a role in guiding today's vote. So there is a large part of us that is celebrating today.At the same time, I have deep concerns that proponents of a free and open Internet may look back on today not as a great victory, but as the first step in what may turn out to be a devastating loss. The Internet has largely been governed from the bottom up by technologists seeking rough consensus and running code. Today's action by the FCC may mark the beginning of a new era where the Internet is regulated by lawyers from the top down. As a technologist and recovering lawyer, that worries me.If you think about it, it's a miracle that the Internet has been as neutral as it has for as long as it has. Throughout history, owners of networks — be they shipping channels, country clubs, Ivy League colleges, banks, roads, or actual telecommunications networks — have profited by charging tolls to access those networks. The Internet has, for the most part, resisted this. There is no ""long distance"" charge on the Internet. You don't pay more to access one website or use one mobile app than another. Bytes, for the most part, are bytes regardless of where they come from or go to.That is not to say there is no risk. Networks tend to be natural monopolies. Consolidation of what are known as ""terminating access providers"" — companies like Comcast that act as ISPs for customers — creates a choke point for the Internet. These companies are in a position to start charging not only their users but also content providers. But, to date, the number of instances of actual abuse by ISPs in the United States has been remarkably low.When proponents of government regulation of the Internet want to point to abuse their poster child is often Netflix. The company's fights with Comcast and other ISPs are well documented. There's little doubt that Netflix's performance suffered on some ISPs where the infrastructure serving the company's movie-streaming bytes became overloaded.Lawyers have a saying: hard cases make bad law. Netflix is a hard case. According to the company, during primetime viewing they are responsible for more than 30% of all U.S. Internet bandwidth use. Remember that the company only launched streaming video seven years ago, and it only really took off about four years ago. In other words, the company has increased U.S. Internet use by a third — on its own — in an extremely short amount of time.As a consumer, it's easy to think of the Internet as an infinite resource, but real atoms carry all those bytes and they have finite capacities. Who pays the cost of delivering that additional 30% of traffic is not straight forward. While it's tempting to say that an ISP like Comcast should pay, is it fair, then, for them to spread that cost over all Comcast subscribers regardless of whether they are Netflix subscribers?Again, because of their remarkable scale and the rate of growth, Netflix makes for an extremely hard case and therefore a tricky poster child. In the end, assuming the whisper numbers are correct on the terms, the commercial arrangement worked out between ISPs and Netflix seems from my perspective to have been a pretty reasonable outcome. The market worked here when giants battled. However, I worry about the non-giants who so far haven't been poster children.The good news is that beyond the exceptional case of Netflix, other abuses of the principle of network neutrality have proven more difficult to find. By in large, today on the Internet, bytes are bytes. CloudFlare delivers a large number of bytes and, so far, we have never been ""shaken down"" by an ISP in order reach their customers. Quite the opposite, as we've grown our cost of delivering a byte has rapidly decreased. In the last 12 months, our global blended average per byte cost has fallen by half, even as we've expanded in expensive markets like Australia, Latin America, and Africa.That's not to say I don't worry. I worry a lot. Comcast, or other large ISPs, could likely extract tolls from a company like ours if they threatened to rate limit or outright block their customers from reaching our network. Legally, before today's FCC vote, there was likely no rule that stopped them. And yet, to date, in spite of their market power, the bottoms-up, normative approach to Internet governance has largely kept ISPs in check and kept the network neutral. This arrangement feels fragile and likely won't last forever, but up until now, I think this is rightly described as the Internet miracle.There is always tension between law and technology. Technology moves fast. Law moves slow. Technology is nimble. Law is a lumbering beast. I like to joke that my job as a lawyer and a programmer were the same: in both cases I was writing code, just as a lawyer it took 10 years and an expensive legal trial for the compiler to let me know if I had a bug.Bad things happen when lawyers and politicians step in too early to regulate technology markets that are still developing. In this case, the FCC not only may be stepping in too early — before we know what the actual, not just theoretical, problems they aim to regulate will be — but they were forced by previous court decisions and political realities to apply the rules written for traditional telephone networks rather than craft a new regulation specific to the unique nature of the Internet.The exact rules the FCC just voted for are not yet public, and we don't know exactly what they will contain. What we do know, however, is that they will stem from Title II of the Federal Telecommunications Act. The problem is that Telecommunications Act comes with 80 years of baggage. The Act, which was originally passed in 1934 under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, has been interpreted by courts and rewritten by Congress a multitude of times. For the programmers reading this, what the FCC is doing is like trying to compile Node.js on MS-DOS. Even if they get it to work, inevitably there will be unintended consequences.There is a philosophical debate in the law about the role of ""rules"" versus ""standards."" For quite some time, in the United States, most roads have had a defined speed limit: say 55 miles per hour. That's a rule. Some stretches of road in Montana were different. There the speed limit was listed as ""reasonable and prudent"" speed. In some cases, say during a sunny day on a straight, clear road, what is ""reasonable and prudent"" may be a lot faster than 55 mph. On the other hand, if it's snowing, 55 mph may be far faster than ""reasonable and prudent."" Montana, in other words, set a standard, not a rule, for their speed limit.Generally, when conditions are well defined, and the optimal outcome is known, then rules are appropriate. When the conditions are more uncertain and the optimal outcome is unknown, then standards are appropriate. I worry that the FCC is about to set down a series of rules for network neutrality before the real threat and the optimal outcome is known.The other problem with rules is that they are brittle. Teams of lawyers will comb through whatever the FCC finally publishes and find any loopholes. There will be defined bright lines going forward and, make no mistake, ISPs will now get as close to those lines as they can. Whatever the Internet's rough consensus of ""acceptable"" was before, it's about to be thrown out in favor of a set of rules written by lawyers. Ironically, that may end up resulting in a regulated network that is less neutral than what we have today.Setting aside political realities, I wish the FCC had done something quite different today. In my ideal alternate universe the FCC chairman would have given something like the following speech:The Internet is one of the greatest inventions in human history. What has made the Internet great is that anyone, anywhere can publish an idea and reach a global audience. Incumbent on us preserving that Internet ideal is that the providers that make up the Internet not discriminate against one idea or another; not favor one byte flowing across their network or disfavor another. This principle of network neutrality is core to the continued success of the Internet.We, as the FCC, are stewards of the communications systems in the United States. The policies of the United States also serve as a precedent for network regulators throughout the rest world. As such, when we act, we must do so with extreme care. To date, the Internet has been governed by a consensus-drive, bottom-up approach. That approach has succeeded in creating the most open, accessible network in human history. Our actions should serve to strengthen, not replace, that approach.That said, there are real concerns about the increasing market power of Internet Service Providers. These providers hold a 100% monopoly on delivering content to each of their customers. Abusing that monopoly position is unacceptable and we, as the FCC, will not tolerate it. We hold, under Title II of the Federal Communications Act, broad powers to crack down on providers that are abusing their trusted position on the network. If we find abuses, ISPs be warned: we will not hesitate to use the full extent of our power.Today, we are articulating a simple standards on network neutrality to which all ISPs will be held:To monitor compliance with this standard, I have hired a team of 100 investigators who will be fielding complaints around the clock from consumers and businesses about ISPs that fail to live up to these standards. We will take allegations of ISPs that do not follow these standards seriously and investigate them to the fullest extent. Non-neutral networks will be put through the equivalent of a legal root canal. And if we find that our current legal framework does not offer the tools to remedy abuses, make no mistake that we can and will act quickly under our full powers of Title II. To ISPs: you're on notice. To Internet users: we will be vigilant.Now, of course, that would satisfy no one. John Oliver would take to his HBO show to yet again call Chairman Wheeler a do-nothing ""dingo."" But, I have a hunch, ISPs would actually act more cautiously and self-police out of fear they incur the full wrath of an FCC armed with specific consumer complaints. The risk of setting bad rules with their unintended consequences would be diminished. And, for at least a bit longer, we may preserve the Internet miracle: where technologists make decisions from the bottom up by rough consensus and running code, guided by the principle that any idea from anyone should be able to reach a global audience.Related PostsJanuary 17, 2014 9:00AMCloudFlare is a strong supporter of a free and open Internet.

"""ACRL TechConnectJohn Oliver describes net neutrality as the most boring important issue. More than that, it’s a complex idea that can be difficult to understand without a strong grasp of the architecture of the internet, which is not at all intuitive. An additional barrier to having a measured response is that most of the public discussions about net neutrality conflate it with negotiations over peering agreements (more on that later) and ultimately rest in contracts with unknown terms. The hyperbole surrounding net neutrality may be useful in riling up public sentiment, but the truth seems far more subtle. I want to approach a definition and an understanding of the issues surrounding net neutrality, but this post will only scratch the surface. Despite the technical and legal complexities, this is something worth understanding, since as academic librarians our daily lives and work revolve around internet access for us and for our students.The most current public debate about net neutrality surrounds the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) ability to regulate internet service providers after a January 2014 court decision struck down the FCC’s 2010 Open Internet Order (PDF). The FCC is currently in an open comment period on a new plan to promote and protect the open internet.The Communications Act of 1934 (PDF) created the FCC to regulate wire and radio communication. This classified phone companies and similar services as “common carriers”, which means that they are open to all equally. If internet service providers are classified in the same way, this ensures equal access, but for various reasons they are not considered common carriers, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2005. The FCC is now seeking to use section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act (PDF) to regulate internet service providers. Section 706 gave the FCC regulatory authority to expand broadband access, particularly to elementary and high schools, and this piece of it is included in the current rulemaking process.The legal part of this is confusing to everyone, not least the FCC. We’ll return to that later. But for now, let’s turn our attention to the technical part of net neutrality, starting with one of the most visible spats.I am a Comcast customer for my home internet. Let’s say I want to watch Netflix. How do I get there from my home computer? First comes the traceroute that shows how the request from my computer travels over the physical lines that make up the internet.                                   7-9. Now the request leaves Comcast, and goes out to a Tier 1 internet provider, which owns cables that cross the country. In this case, the cables belong to CenturyLink (which recently purchased Qwest).          Why should Comcast ask Netflix to pay to transmit their data over Comcast’s networks? Understanding this requires a few additional concepts.Peering is an important concept in the structure of the internet. Peering is a physical link of hardware to hardware between networks in internet exchanges, which are (as pictured above) huge buildings filled with routers connected to each other. 8.  Facebook Peering is an example of a very open peering policy. Companies and internet service providers can use internet exchange centers to plug their equipment together directly, and so make their connections faster and more reliable. For websites such as Facebook which have an enormous amount of upload and download traffic, it’s well worth the effort for a small internet service provider to peer with Facebook 9.Peering relies on some equality of traffic, as the name implies. The various tiers of internet service providers you may have heard of are based on with whom they “peer”. Tier 1 ISPs are large enough that they all peer with each other, and thus form what is usually called the backbone of the internet.Academic institutions created the internet originally–computer science departments at major universities literally had the switches in their buildings. In the US this was ARPANET, but a variety of networks at academic institutions existed throughout the world. Groups such as Internet2 allow educational, research, and government networks to connect and peer with each other and commercial entities (including Facebook, if the traceroute from my workstation is any indication). Smaller or isolated institutions may rely on a consumer ISP, and what bandwidth is available to them may be limited by geography.Consumers, by contrast, are really at the mercy of whatever company dominates in their neighborhoods. Consumers obviously do not have the resources to lay their own fiber optic cables directly to all the websites they use most frequently. They rely on an internet service provider to do the heavy lifting, just as most of us rely on utility companies to get electricity, water, and sewage service (though of course it’s quite possible to live off the grid to a certain extent on all those services depending on where you live). We also don’t build our own roads, and we expect that certain spaces are open for traveling through by anyone. This idea of roads open for all to get from the wider world to arterial streets to local neighborhoods is thus used as an analogy for the internet–if internet service providers (like phone companies) must be common carriers, this ensures the middle and last miles aren’t jammed.Think about how peering works–it requires a roughly equal amount of traffic being sent and received through peered networks, or at least an amount of traffic to which both parties can agree. This is the problem with Netflix. Unlike big companies such as Facebook, and especially Google, Netflix is not trying to build its own network. It relies on content delivery services and internet backbone providers to get content from its servers (all hosted on Amazon Web Services) to consumers. But Netflix only sends traffic, it doesn’t take traffic, and this is the basis of most of the legal battles going on with internet service providers that service the “last mile”.The Netflix/Comcast trouble started in 2010, when Netflix contracted with Level 3 for content delivery. Comcast claimed that Level 3 was relying on a peering relationship that was no longer valid with this increase in traffic, no matter who was sending it. (See this article for complete details.) Level 3, incidentally, accused another Tier 1 provider, Cogent, of overstepping their settlement-free peering agreement back in 2005, and cut them off for a short time, which cut pieces of the internet off from each other.Netflix tried various arrangements, but ultimately negotiated with Comcast to pay for direct access to their last mile networks through internet exchanges, one of which is illustrated above in steps 4-6. This seems to be the most reasonable course of action for Netflix to get their outbound content over networks, since they really don’t have the ability to do settlement-free peering. Of course, Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, didn’t see it that way. But for most cases, settlement-free peering is still the only way the internet can actually work, and while we may not see the agreements that make this happen, it won’t be going anywhere. In this case, Comcast was not offering Netflix paid prioritization of its content, it was negotiating for delivery of the content at all. This might seem equally wrong, but someone has to pay for the bandwidth, and why shouldn’t Netflix pay for it?If companies want to connect with each other or build their own network connections, they can do under whatever terms work best for them. The problem would be if certain companies were using the same lines that everyone was using but their packets got preferential treatment. The imperfect road analogy works well enough for these purposes. When a firetruck, police car, and ambulance are racing through traffic with sirens blazing, we are usually ok with the resulting traffic jam since we can see this requires that speed for an emergency situation. But how do we feel when we suspect a single police car has turned on a siren just to cut in line to get to lunch faster? Or a funeral procession blocks traffic? Or an elected official has a motorcade? Or a block party? These situations are regulated by government authorities, but we may or may not like that these uses of public ways are being allowed and causing our own travel to slow down. Going further, it is clearly illegal for a private company to block a public road and charge a high rate for faster travel, but imagine if no governmental agency had the power to regulate this? The FCC is attempting to make sure they have those regulatory powers.That said it doesn’t seem like anyone is actually planning to offer paid prioritization. Even Comcast claims “no company has had a stronger commitment to openness of the Internet…” and that they have no plans of offering such a service . I find it unlikely that we will face a situation that Barbara Stripling describes as “prioritizing Mickey Mouse and Jennifer Lawrence over William Shakespeare and Teddy Roosevelt.”I certainly won’t advocate against treating ISPs as common carriers–my impression is that this is what the 1996 Telecommunications Act was trying to get at, though the legal issues are confounding. However, a larger problem facing libraries (not so much large academics, but smaller academics and publics) is the digital divide. If there’s no fiber optic line to a town, there isn’t going to be broadband access, and an internet service provider has no business incentive to create a line for a small town that may not generate a lot of revenue. I think we need to remain vigilant about ensuring that everyone has access to the internet at all or at a fast speed, and not get too sidetracked about theoretical future possible malfeasance by internet service providers. These points are included in the FCC’s proposal, but are not receiving most of the attention, despite the fact that they are given explicit regulatory authority to do this.Public comments are open at the FCC’s website until July 15, so take the opportunity to leave a comment about Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet, and also consider comments on E-rate and broadband access, which is another topic the FCC is currently considering.

			Trending:		Following the Federal Communications Commission’s approval Thursday to repeal the open-internet rules known as net neutrality, the future of the internet is very certain for some but not for others.Opponents to the rule change are already threatening to sue to bring back the rules the agency adopted two years ago. But those in favor, including FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who made the proposal last month, don’t expect a big change in how businesses or consumers stream movies, shop online or use the internet.For those outside of the commission, the reality of what this could mean for business was already sinking in.“We are a small ecommerce company that competes, and in some cases, sells goods similar to far larger players,” said Lee Meyer, CEO of interior design site Havenly.com, which is based in Denver. “The risk, economically, to us, is that ISPs begin to charge high fees for the fastest connections to consumers — fees that a company of our size can’t reasonably bear. In the consumer world, speed has a direct impact on conversion. This decision could potentially have serious impacts on what made small internet based business possible in the first place — a free and fair internet.”Nothing will change immediately. The Office of Management and Budget must first approve the rule.The case will probably end up court, said Blake E. Reid, a University of Colorado Boulder law professor who specializes in technology policy and telecom law. While there is a movement by some Democrats to reverse the order, it would need bipartisan support, a veto-proof majority and a presidential signature.“Several public interest groups have announced plans to sue the FCC over the order. That challenge will be reviewed by a 3-judge panel at the DC Circuit and may ultimately be reviewed by the full court. It could also go up to the Supreme Court. The courts will consider whether the FCC’s reasoning in repealing the rules was arbitrary and capricious,” he said.Simultaneously, a separate proposal to create a new net neutrality law could happen. That, he said, “would likely require amending the Communications Act. How that might unfold is a lot harder to predict.”Cameron Williams, founder and Chief Technology Officer of Denver security company OverwatchID, had hoped the vote would go the other way. As the owner of a small business that uses the internet to distribute its ID security software, Williams fears his much larger competition, or competitors that get snapped up by an AT&T or another large ISP that could favor its own services over Overwatch’s.“It’s very disconcerting for sure,” Williams said. “If our competition can afford to pay a premium (to speed up internet service) that we don’t have the budget to pay for, that puts us at a significant disadvantage.”With a staff of 30 employees, Overwatch would probably have to hire someone to monitor whether company data is getting to clients as consistently fast as his competition.“I hope this goes to the Supreme Court and gets overturned,” Williams said.Ting Internet, which is working with the city of Centennial to offer gigabit internet to residents, has long voiced its support for net neutrality. After the vote, Ting officials said they don’t plan to change their business. Officials with NextLight, a community-owned internet utility service in Longmont, also said there will be no changes.But the state’s leading internet providers have opposed net neutrality from the start. Comcast created an uproar this year when it removed some wording online that detailed its net neutrality protections — including deleting that it won’t “create paid fast lanes.” The company responded saying it has no plans to block or throttle data, or discriminate against lawful content.CenturyLink has said it was pleased that the FCC moved forward on the issue, but on Thursday, the company said it wasn’t ready to comment.“We look forward to working with the FCC to ensure that the internet experience for consumers and businesses, as well as the exchange of internet traffic between providers, remains positive and beneficial to all. However, we are going to wait and review the entire text of the FCC net neutrality order before commenting further to make sure we understand how the order may affect our operations and our customers,” the company said.
Boulder-based Zayo Group, which provides internet to office buildings around the globe, said the vote to overturn net neutrality won’t impact its services as an internet backbone provider.“We believe our role at Zayo is aligned with our mission to provide enormous high-quality bandwidth and communications infrastructure to support our customers no matter what regulatory changes may take place,” the company said in a statement.Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts""",,,

"""Filed under:Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, and others spread their money far and wide to influence your governmentThe FCC is about to give massive internet service providers the power to divide the internet. It is at risk of becoming unrecognizable. A vital global utility that has been a boon to creative and economic freedom for people around the world may be turned into a twisted land of tolls and corporate control.The stakes are high. The internet now touches every town, every city, and every single one of us — whether we use it or not. Those who control the network control the future. The FCC is the current venue for this fight, but Congress will eventually intervene. As telecom expert Susan Crawford argues, the FCC is “being outrageous” to force Congress’ involvement. And both net neutrality advocates and the telecom industry have asked for lawmakers to act. Advocates believe a law will make net neutrality more durable. But ISPs are betting they’ll be able to write the bill — because they’ve paid for the opportunity.In March, we published a story that showed contributions from the ISP industry to members of Congress who voted to repeal a landmark FCC privacy rule, opening the door to the sale of customer data. It was one of our most popular stories of the year, and many of you asked why we only published contributions to some members of Congress. Incidentally, every one of the 265 members who voted for the measure in March were Republicans. And many of those same members endorse the effort to end net neutrality. But it’s fair to want to see monetary influence across all of Congress. While it is clear that alignment with the ISPs is currently drawn along party lines, the industry’s attempt to gain favor with lawmakers is not partisan. Entrenched telecommunications companies liberally spread money and attention to everyone who holds office. Sometimes that influence comes in the form of lavish parties with Olympic athletes and lobbyists, but consistently it comes in the form of contributions to campaigns. It’s impossible to quantify the overall influence of this powerful industry, but we can chart some of it. Below you will find contributions to individual members of Congress, and those members’ leadership PACs, from 1989 to the present day. This money came from the telecommunication industry’s own PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals’ immediate families.

To assist you in reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have provided definitions of some of these terms below.3G - Third generation of cellular wireless standards and successor to the 2G standard.4G - Fourth generation of cellular wireless standards. It is a successor to 3G and 2G standards, with the aim to provide a wide range of data services, with rates up to gigabit-speed Internet access for mobile, as well as stationary users.Bandwidth infrastructure - Dark fiber, mobile infrastructure and lit: bandwidth services provided over fiber networks, and datacenter-based colocation and interconnection services. Fiber-based bandwidth infrastructure services that are lit (i.e., provided by using optronics that “light” the fiber) include wavelengths, Ethernet, IP, and SONET; fiber-based services that are not lit are sold as dark-fiber capacity. Datacenter- based bandwidth infrastructure services include colocation (space and power) as well as interconnection within facilities.Capacity - The information carrying ability of a telecommunications service. Below is a list of some common units of capacity for various lit bandwidth services:DS-0, DS-1 and DS-3 - Data communication circuits capable of transmitting over SONET (or similar) at 64 Kbps, 1.544 Mb and 45 Mb, respectively.OC-3, OC-12, OC-48 and OC-192 - Data communication circuits capable of transmitting over SONET at 155 Mb, 622 Mb, 2.5G and 10G, respectively.1G, 2.5G, 10G, 40G and 100G -  Data communication circuits capable of transmitting over Wavelengths at 1G, 2.5G, 10G, 40G and 100G, respectively.10Mb and 100Mb - Data communication circuits capable of transmitting over Ethernet at 10 Mb and 100 Mb, respectively.GigE and 10GigE -  Data communication circuits capable of transmitting over Ethernet at 1G and 10G.Carrier - A provider of communications services that commonly include voice, data and Internet services.Carrier hotel - A building containing many carriers and other telecommunications service providers that are widely interconnected. These facilities generally have high-capacity power service, backup batteries and generators, fuel storage, riser cable systems, large cooling capability, and advanced fire suppression systems.Cellular tower - An outdoor structure primarily used to attach and house antennae used by wireless carriers to aggregate and transmit mobile voice and data.CLEC - Competitive local exchange carrier; provides local telecommunications services in competition with the ILEC.Cloud computing - An Internet-based or intranet-based computing environment wherein computing resources are distributed across the network (i.e., the “cloud”), dynamically allocated on an individual or pooled basis, and increased or reduced as circumstances warrant, to handle the computing task at hand.Colocation - The housing of transport equipment, other communications equipment, servers and storage devices within the same location. Operators of these colocation facilities typically also sell interconnection services to their customers, enabling them to cross connect with other customers located within the same facility and/or with Bandwidth Infrastructure providers.Conduit - A pipe, usually made of metal, ceramic or plastic, that protects buried fiber optic cables.Data center - A facility used to house computer systems, backup storage devices, routers, services and other Internet and other telecommunications equipment. Data centers generally have environmental controls (air conditioning, fire suppression, etc.), redundant/backup power supplies, redundant data communications connections and high security.Dark fiber - Fiber that has not yet been connected to telecommunications transmission equipment or optronics and, therefore, has not yet been activated or “lit” by the fiber cable owner.i DS - Digital signal level; a measure of the transmission rate of digital telecommunications traffic. For example, DS-1 corresponds to 1.544 Mb and DS-3 corresponds to 45 Mb. See the definition of “Capacity” above.DWDM - Dense wavelength-division multiplexing. The term “dense” refers to the number of channels being multiplexed. A DWDM system typically has the capability to multiplex up to 40 wavelength channels.Ethernet - The standard local area network (LAN) protocol. Ethernet was originally specified to connect devices on a company or home network as well as to a cable modem or DSL modem for Internet access. Due to its ubiquity in the LAN, Ethernet has become a popular transmission protocol in metropolitan, regional and long haul networks as well.Fiber miles - The number of route miles in a network multiplied by the number of fiber strands within each cable on the network. For example, if a ten-mile network segment has a 144 count fiber installed, it would represent a 10x144 or 1,440 fiber miles.Fiber - Fiber, or fiber optic cables, are thin filaments of glass through which light beams are transmitted over long distances.Fiber-to-the-Tower or FTT - The connection of cellular towers to the wider terrestrial network via fiber connections.G - Gigabits per second, a measure of telecommunications transmission speed. One gigabit equals one billion bits of information.ILEC - Incumbent local exchange carrier; a traditional telecommunications provider that, prior to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, had the exclusive right and responsibility for providing local telecommunications services in its local service area.Interconnection service - A service that is used to connect two customers who are located within a single building or within a single colocation space using either fiber or other means.IP - Internet protocol; the transmission protocol used in the transmission of data over the Internet.IRU and IRU contract—Indefeasible right of use. The exclusive, unrestricted, and indefeasible right to use one, a pair, or more strands of fiber of a fiber cable. IRU contracts are typically long-term in nature (20 years) and may or may not contain restrictions on the use of the fiber by the lessee.ISP - Internet service provider; provides access to the Internet for consumers and businesses.Lateral - An extension from the main or core portion of a network to a customer’s premises or other connection point.Mb - Megabits per second; a measure of telecommunications transmission speed. One megabit equals one million bits of information.Meet-Me Room - A physical location in a building, usually a data center or carrier hotel, where voice carriers, Internet service providers, data service providers and others physically interconnect so that traffic can be passed between their respective networks. At any given colocation facility or data center, network owners may also be able to interconnect outside the Meet-Me Room.Mobile switching centers - Buildings where wireless service providers house their Internet routers and voice switching equipment.NOC - Network operations center; a location that is used to monitor networks, troubleshoot network degradations and outages, and ensure customer network outages and other network degradations are restored.OC - Optical carrier level; a measure of the transmission rate of optical telecommunications traffic. For example, OC-3 corresponds to 155 Mb. See the definition of “Capacity,” above.On-net— Describes a location or service that is directly and fully supported by fiber.Optronics - Various types of equipment that are commonly used to light fiber. Optronics include systems that are capable of providing wavelength, Ethernet, IP, SONET, and other service over fiber optic cable.POP - Point-of-presence; a location in a building separate from colocation facilities and data centers that houses equipment used to provide telecom or Bandwidth Infrastructure services.ii Private line - Dedicated private bandwidth circuit that generally utilizes SONET, Ethernet and wavelength technology used to connect various locations.Route miles - The length, measured in non-overlapping miles, of a fiber network. That is the actual number of miles that a network cable traverses. Route miles are distinct from fiber miles (see fiber miles definition).Small cell - A location other than a cellular tower or building that is used to attach an antennae used by a wireless carriers to aggregate and transmit mobile voice and data. Typically, the location is a light pole, traffic light, or other small separate purpose structure.SONET - Synchronous optical network; a network protocol traditionally used to support private line services. This protocol enables transmission of voice, data and video at high speeds. Protected SONET networks provide for virtually instantaneous restoration of service in the event of a fiber cut or equipment failure.Switch - An electronic device that selects the path that voice, data and Internet traffic take or use on a network.Transport - A dedicated telecommunication service to move data, Internet, voice, video or wireless traffic from one location to another.Wavelength - A channel of light that carries telecommunications traffic through the process of wavelength-division multiplexing.   iii PART IITEM 1. BUSINESSOverviewZayo Group Holdings, Inc. (the “Company, “we” or “us”) is a large and fast growing provider of bandwidth infrastructure in the United States and Europe. Our products and services enable mission-critical, high-bandwidth applications, such as cloud-based computing, video, mobile, social media, machine-to-machine connectivity, and other bandwidth-intensive applications. Key products include leased dark fiber, fiber to cellular towers and small cell sites, dedicated wavelength connections, Ethernet and IP connectivity and other high-bandwidth offerings. We provide our services over a unique set of dense metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks and through our interconnect-oriented datacenter facilities. Our fiber networks and datacenter facilities are critical components of the overall physical network architecture of the Internet and private networks. Our customer base includes some of the largest and most sophisticated consumers of bandwidth infrastructure services, such as wireless service providers; telecommunications service providers; financial services companies; social networking, media, and web content companies; education, research, and healthcare institutions; and governmental agencies. We typically provide our bandwidth infrastructure services for a fixed monthly recurring fee under contracts that vary between one and twenty years in length.  We operate our business with a unique focus on capital allocation and financial performance with the ultimate goal of maximizing equity value for our stockholders. Our core values center on partnership, alignment, and transparency with our three primary constituent groups - employees, customers, and stockholders.We were founded in 2007 with the investment thesis of building a bandwidth infrastructure platform to take advantage of the favorable Internet, data, and wireless growth trends driving the on-going demand for bandwidth infrastructure, and to be an active participant in the consolidation of the industry. The growth of cloud-based computing, video, mobile and social media applications, machine-to-machine connectivity, and other bandwidth-intensive applications continues to drive rapidly increasing consumption of bandwidth on a global basis Cisco estimates that mobile data traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 57% from 2014 to 2019 and that IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 21% from 2013 to 2018. As an early believer in the enduring nature of these trends, we assembled our asset base and built a business model specifically to provide high-bandwidth connectivity to customers whose businesses depend most on the continuous and growing demand for bandwidth. As a core tenet of our strategy for capitalizing on these industry trends, we have been a leading industry consolidator and have acquired 34 bandwidth infrastructure businesses and assets to date. Our owned, secure, and redundant fiber network and datacenters serve as the foundation for our bandwidth solutions and allow us to offer customers both physical infrastructure and cloud and connectivity services. We believe the continuously growing demand for stable and secure bandwidth from service providers, enterprises and consumers, combined with our unique and dense metro, regional, and long-haul networks, position us as a mission-critical infrastructure supplier to the largest users of bandwidth.Our network footprint includes both large and small metro geographies, the extended suburban regions of many cities, and the large rural, national and international links that connect our metro networks. We believe that our network assets would be difficult to replicate given the geographic reach, network density, and capital investment required. Our fiber networks span over 85,500 route miles and 6,700,000 fiber miles (representing an average of 78 fibers per route), served 320 geographic markets in the United States and Europe, and connect to approximately 18,000 buildings, including 5,000 cellular towers and 863 datacenters. We own fiber networks in over 300 metro markets, including large metro areas, such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Paris, and London, as well as smaller metro areas, such as Allentown, Pennsylvania, Fargo, North Dakota, and Spokane, Washington. Our networks allow us to provide our high-bandwidth infrastructure services to our customers over redundant fiber facilities between key customer locations.  We believe our ownership and the location and density of our expansive network footprint allow us to more competitively service our target customers’ bandwidth infrastructure needs at the local, regional, national, and international level relative to other regional bandwidth infrastructure service providers or long-haul carriers. We also provide our network-neutral colocation and interconnection services utilizing our own datacenters located within major carrier hotels and other strategic buildings in 45 locations throughout the United States and France and operate more than 520,000 square feet of billable colocation space.1 The density and geographic reach of our network footprint allow us to provide tailored bandwidth infrastructure solutions on our own network (“on-net”) that address the current and future bandwidth needs of our customers. Our dense metro and regional networks have high fiber counts that enable us to provide both our physical infrastructure services (e.g., dark fiber) and our cloud and connectivity services (e.g., wavelengths and Ethernet). Our networks are deep and scalable, meaning we have spare fiber, conduit access rights and/or rights of way rights that allow us to continue to add capacity to our network as our existing and new customers’ demand for our services increases. In addition, many of our core network technologies provide capacity through which we can continue to add wavelengths to our network without consuming additional fiber. We also believe the density and diversity of our networks provide a strong and growing competitive barrier to protect our existing revenue base. We believe our networks provide significant opportunity to organically connect to new customer locations, datacenters, towers, or small cell locations to help us achieve an attractive return on our capital deployed. Since our founding, we have assembled a large portfolio of fiber networks and colocation assets through both acquisitions and customer demand-driven investments in property and equipment. From our inception to date, we have completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase consideration, net of cash acquired, totaling approximately $4.6 billion. For the period from July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2015, we also invested over $1.2 billion in capital expenditures, exclusive of acquisitions and stimulus grant reimbursements, primarily to expand the reach and capacity of our networks. As of June 30, 2015, our total debt (including capital lease obligations and before any unamortized discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs) was $3,785.1 million and was primarily incurred in connection with acquisitions.Our business model focuses on providing on-net bandwidth infrastructure solutions to our customers, which results in what we refer to as “infrastructure economics.” Infrastructure economics are characterized by attractive revenue visibility, strong margins coupled with operating leverage for new revenue, success-based capital investments with low maintenance capital needs, and the ability to generate significant cash flow over time. Our capital expenditure investments are predominantly success-based, meaning that before we commit resources to expand our network, we have a signed customer contract that will provide us with an attractive return on the required capital. After committing capital to connect additional customer sites, our goal is to sell additional high-bandwidth connectivity on these new routes at a relatively low incremental cost, which further enhances the return we extract from our asset base. Finally, the combination of our scale and infrastructure economics results in the ability to generate meaningful free cash flow over time.Our management is intensely focused on creating equity value for our stockholders. Our equity value creation philosophy includes regular and rigorous financial and operational measurement, financial transparency (both internally and externally), and clear alignment of interests among employees, management, and stockholders. Our real-time measurement and reporting system serves as the foundation for our decision making and our extensive financial and operational disclosure. We also believe in fostering an entrepreneurial culture that aligns the interests of our employees, management, and stockholders.We are a Delaware corporation formed in 2007.  As of June 30, 2015, we had 1,833 employees.Our fiscal year ends June 30 each year and we refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 as “Fiscal 2015”, the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 as “Fiscal 2014”, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as “Fiscal 2013”.Bandwidth Infrastructure IndustryWe are a bandwidth infrastructure provider, and our services are a critical component of the broader $2 trillion global communications industry. Bandwidth infrastructure, consisting primarily of fiber networks and interconnect-oriented colocation facilities, plays a fundamental role in the communications value chain, similar to other types of infrastructure such as datacenters and cellular towers. Bandwidth infrastructure assets are a critical resource, connecting datacenters, cellular towers, and other carrier and private networks to support the substantial growth in global data, voice and video consumption by both business and individual consumers.2 Industry HistoryOur industry has changed substantially over the past 16 years. The first phase of the bandwidth infrastructure industry occurred with the advent of the Internet and the ensuing dot com era in the late 1990s. This led to the first major wave of fiber network deployments as a number of companies of varying backgrounds invested billions of dollars in fiber network construction throughout the U.S. and Europe. These fiber network developers included companies with national and international plans (e.g., Level 3 Communications, Qwest Communications, Williams Communications) and more regional plans (e.g., 360networks, Progress Telecom, OnFiber). Following these network builds, many of the fiber companies struggled in the early 2000s due to the lack of sufficient demand for their high-bandwidth services. Bandwidth demand during this timeframe was limited by the fact that many bandwidth-intensive applications (e.g. streaming video, cloud, mobile broadband, big data analytics, etc.) were either not yet contemplated or still very early in their life cycle. Instead, the majority of traffic at the time was low-bandwidth services such as voice and dial-up modem connections. In addition, the similarity of the fiber routes deployed resulted in significant overcapacity and associated pricing pressure, leaving a “last mile” gap and heavy competition and overcapacity along these routes. These two primary factors combined to significantly limit the fiber network providers’ operating cash flows, resulting in the majority of these companies transitioning their business models, consolidating and/or seeking bankruptcy protection.In the following years, a substantial expansion in computing power and bandwidth-intensive applications drove meaningful bandwidth traffic growth. This growth highlighted the need to address the “last mile” gap by bringing bandwidth capacity directly to both the consumer and business end user. The capacity and performance of the consumer last mile connection was primarily addressed by the expansion of cable networks and through mobile network development by wireless carriers (supported by cellular tower operators). The growing bandwidth demand of business end users was addressed by a number of focused fiber developers constructing new networks to directly connect to datacenters, cellular towers, government facilities, schools, hospitals and other locations with high-bandwidth needs. These fiber network companies were generally local or regional in nature, and were most often either survivors of the initial fiber development wave, subsidiaries of a utility parent, or owned by entrepreneurs. This period is also noted for increased financial discipline following the large speculative capital deployments of the dot com era. This is the timeframe and industry environment in which our Company was founded.The Industry TodayThe acceleration in the development of bandwidth-intensive devices and applications has resulted in a significant need to further fill in the “last mile” gap, leading to substantial capital investments in fiber networks by bandwidth infrastructure providers. Bandwidth infrastructure service providers support applications such as high definition television broadcasting and video; online streaming video; cloud applications replacing in-house enterprise software platforms; and explosive mobile data consumption (Cisco found that, in 2013, global mobile data traffic grew 81% and was nearly 18 times the size of the entire global Internet in 2000). Companies whose services require large amounts of bandwidth and enterprises that consume large amounts of bandwidth are struggling to adapt to this rapidly evolving landscape, and the bandwidth infrastructure industry is growing in economic importance as it addresses this critical need. In addition to these demand trends, there has been significant consolidation amongst the bandwidth infrastructure services providers, validating a core tenet of the Company’s founding investment thesis. This has been most pronounced amongst fiber providers in the U.S., with over 60 transactions within the past 10 years (approximately half of which have been consummated by us), and to a lesser degree in Europe. Industry ParticipantsWe view the participants in today’s communications industry in two distinct categories: •Providers of Infrastructure.    Companies that own and operate infrastructure assets that are used to market and deliver infrastructure services. We believe these assets would be difficult to replicate given the significant capital, time, permitting, and expertise required. Providers of infrastructure typically enjoy long-term customer contracts, a highly visible and recurring revenue base, and attractive margins. We further categorize these providers of infrastructure as follows: oBandwidth Infrastructure Providers:    Owners of bandwidth infrastructure assets comprised of fiber networks and interconnect-oriented colocation facilities. Bandwidth infrastructure services include dark fiber, lit services (wavelengths, Ethernet, IP, and SONET), and colocation and interconnection services for the purpose of transporting mission-critical traffic including data, voice, and video. oDatacenter Providers:    Owners of datacenter facilities that include raised floor, power and cooling infrastructure. These facilities house and support networking and computing equipment for carrier networks, enterprise cloud platforms, content distribution networks, and other mission-critical applications. oCellular Tower Providers:    Owners of cellular towers, the physical infrastructure upon which antennas and associated equipment are co-located for the wireless carrier industry.3  •Users of Infrastructure.    Users of infrastructure may purchase infrastructure services either to provide value-added services to their customers or for their own private network requirements. We further categorize these users of infrastructure as follows: oCommunications Service Providers.    Communication service providers, such as wireless service providers, ILECs, CLECs, and ISPs, are companies that use infrastructure to package, market, and sell value-added communications services such as voice, Internet, data, video, wireless, and hosting solutions. oEnd Users.    End users are public sector entities and private enterprises that purchase infrastructure services for their own internal networks. Note that end users may also address their needs by purchasing value-added services from communications service providers.The Market OpportunityThe proliferation of smart devices and mobile broadband, real-time streaming video, social networks, online gaming, machine-to-machine connectivity, big data analytics, and cloud computing will continue to drive substantial consumer and business demand for bandwidth. Cisco estimates that mobile data traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 57% from 2014 to 2019 and that IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 21% from 2013 to 2018. Additionally, according to Gartner, “4.9 billion connected things will be in use in 2015, up 30 percent from 2014, and will reach 25 billion by 2020. The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a powerful force for business transformation, and its disruptive impact will be felt across all industries and all areas of society.” (Gartner Press Release, “Gartner Says 4.9 Billion Connected ‘Things’ Will Be in Use in 2015,” November 11, 2014, http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/idl2905717).  Communications service providers develop and deliver value-added solutions that are tailored to mass market residential and enterprise customers whose needs continue to grow and evolve as bandwidth trends expand. Given this rapid growth and the complexity and cost of building and maintaining networks, communications service providers are increasingly looking to bandwidth infrastructure providers to augment the reach and performance of their own networks and support the delivery of the services their customers demand. As this dynamic continues, bandwidth infrastructure providers will become further entrenched as mission-critical partners to the communications service providers.Similarly, end users such as private enterprises (e.g., media/content providers, financial institutions, and hospital systems) and public sector entities (e.g., governmental agencies and school districts) have experienced significant growth and change in the role that bandwidth plays within their organizations. As these needs continue to grow in both volume and criticality, end users will increasingly choose to directly procure bandwidth infrastructure services in order to gain more security, control and scale in their internal network operations. An example of this disintermediation is the trend of large school districts, adapting to e-education requirements, directly purchasing dark fiber as a replacement to more value-added solutions. We believe that, as these dynamics play out across all industries, the number of end users directly seeking bandwidth infrastructure services will continue to expand.By focusing on the reach, density, and performance of their physical networks, bandwidth infrastructure providers can deliver customized services to communications service providers and end users more quickly and with superior economics than these users could otherwise self-provide. Whether providing fiber connectivity to a wireless provider’s towers to enable mobile broadband, supplying a national communications service provider with a metro fiber footprint in new markets, providing a lit bandwidth connection to multiple enterprise datacenters for an industrial company, providing interconnection capabilities to a hosting company within a datacenter, or solving for the next society-impacting innovation, bandwidth infrastructure providers will continue to invest in and expand their infrastructure assets to meet this growing demand.Given the natural economies of scale, there has been significant consolidation among bandwidth infrastructure providers, particularly in the U.S. We believe this consolidation trend will continue in the U.S. and is beginning in Europe. Combined with the barriers to new entrants, we foresee a decreasing number of bandwidth infrastructure providers against a backdrop of continued strong demand for their services.Our Bandwidth Infrastructure AssetsOur bandwidth infrastructure assets consist of our fiber networks, the optronic equipment used to provide our lit services over our fiber networks, and our datacenters where we provide colocation and interconnection services.4 Our Fiber NetworksOur fiber network footprint includes both large and small metro geographies, the extended suburban regions of many cities, and the large rural, national and international fiber links that connect our metro networks. Our network represents a collection of assets that we believe is difficult to replicate. Our fiber networks span over 85,500 route miles and 6,700,000 fiber miles (representing an average of 78 fibers per route), serve approximately 320 geographic markets in the United States and Europe, and connect approximately 18,000 buildings, including approximately 5,000 cellular towers and 863 datacenters. Our networks allow us to provide our high-bandwidth infrastructure services to our customers over redundant fiber facilities between critical customer locations. We believe the expansiveness and density of our fiber network footprint allow us to more competitively service our target customers’ bandwidth infrastructure needs at the local, regional, national, and international level relative to other regional or long-haul bandwidth infrastructure service providers. Our fiber networks also have the following key attributes: •Extensive Coverage.    Our fiber networks are located across large and small metro geographies, the extended metro and suburban regions of many cities, and traverse large rural areas to connect metro markets. This network coverage allows us to address our target customers’ needs in a variety of geographies and for a variety of applications, all while remaining “on-net” and maintaining infrastructure economics. •Scalable Network Architecture.    Our networks are scalable, meaning we often have spare fiber, conduit access rights and/or rights of way that allow us to continue to add capacity to our network as our customers’ demand for our services increases. In addition, the majority of our core fiber network segments utilize DWDM systems, nearly all of which have spare capacity through which we can continue to add wavelengths to our network without consuming additional fiber. •Modern Fiber and Optronics.    Our modern fiber networks support current generation optronic equipment including DWDM systems, carrier class Ethernet switches and IP routers. This equipment is used to provide our lit services. The vast majority of our networks are capable of supporting next generation technologies with minimal capital investment.Metro Fiber Networks.    We use our metro fiber networks to provide bandwidth infrastructure services within the metro markets that we serve. Our metro networks are most commonly used in the following two scenarios.  First, to provide service between on-net buildings that are located in the same geographic market. Second, to connect our on-net buildings within a metro market to another metro market via our regional and/or long-haul networks. We continue to expand our metro fiber networks within the metro geography and into the surrounding suburban areas as we extend to additional buildings to meet new demand on a success basis. Success-based expansion means that before we commit resources to expand our network, we have a signed customer contract that will provide us with an attractive return on required capital. In many of our metro markets, we have high count fiber cables (sometimes as many as 864 fibers per cable) and in some cases multiple spare conduits on our metro fiber routes. On individual segments where our fiber capacity becomes highly utilized, we seek to augment that capacity also on a success basis.Regional and Long-haul Fiber Networks.    We use our regional fiber networks to provide bandwidth infrastructure services between the metro markets that we serve. Our regional and long-haul networks are most commonly used in the following three scenarios.  First, to provide service between on-net buildings that are located in different large markets (for example, Chicago and New York). Second, to connect our on-net buildings in small and mid-sized markets back to major datacenters, wireless switching centers, and carrier hotels in larger markets (for example, between Lima, Ohio and Cleveland, Ohio). Third, occasionally our networks provide service between on-net buildings in two different small or mid-sized markets located on various parts of our regional networks (for example, between Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Alexandria, Minnesota). We seek to continue to add new segments and markets to our regional and long-haul networks on a success basis, supported by a customer contract. We have deployed current generation DWDM technologies across the majority of our regional and long-haul networks, allowing a current maximum scaling to four Terabytes (i.e. 4,000G) of bandwidth and the ability to add capacity as demand for bandwidth increases. We expect that as technology continues to advance, we will augment and invest in our regional and long-haul networks accordingly.Fiber-to-the-Tower Networks.    We operate fiber-to-the-tower networks across our fiber network footprint. We connect to approximately 5,000 cellular towers and have contracts with multiple national wireless carriers to build out to approximately 2,500 additional towers. These FTT networks provide our customers with bandwidth infrastructure services that offer significantly improved speed, scale, performance and service levels relative to legacy copper and microwave networks. Our FTT networks are scalable, which means that we can quickly and easily increase the amount of bandwidth that we provide to each of the towers as our customers’ wireless data networks grow. Our FTT markets are generally in areas where we already have dense fiber networks (either metro or regional), which affords us the ability to offer ring-protected mobile infrastructure services. We are increasingly providing dark fiber services on our FTT networks.5 Through these fiber networks, we provide service to over approximately 18,000 on-net buildings and are continually making success-based capital investments to increase our on-net building footprint. On-net buildings are buildings that are directly connected via fiber to our long-haul, regional, metro, and FTT networks. Our customers generally purchase our bandwidth infrastructure services to transport their data, Internet, wireless and voice traffic between buildings directly connected to our network. The types of buildings connected to our network primarily consist of the following: •Datacenters, Carrier Hotels and Central Offices.    These buildings house multiple consumers of bandwidth infrastructure services, serving as telecommunications and content exchange points. Our fiber networks generally connect the most important of these buildings in the markets where we operate. We have over 1,400 of these types of facilities connected to our network. •Single-Tenant, High-Bandwidth Locations.    Generally these are other telecom, media or Internet content buildings that house a single large consumer of bandwidth infrastructure services. Examples of these buildings include video aggregation sites, mobile switching centers and carrier POPs. Our network is connected to these buildings only when the tenant is a customer. We currently have over 2,000 single-tenant, high-bandwidth locations on-net. •Cellular Towers.    We connect to cellular towers and other locations that house wireless antennas. We have approximately 5,000 cellular towers on-net, and we are actively constructing fiber to over an additional 2,500. Typically, towers have multiple tenants, which provide us with the opportunity to sell services to those additional tenants. •Enterprise Buildings.    Our network extends to over 10,700 enterprise buildings. This grouping contains a mix of single tenant and multi-tenant enterprise buildings and includes hospitals, corporate datacenters, schools, government buildings, research centers and other key corporate locations that require bandwidth infrastructure services.Our zColo DatacentersMany of our zColo datacenter facilities are located in some of the most important carrier hotels in the United States, including 60 Hudson Street and 111 8th Avenue in New York; 165 Halsey Street in Newark; 401 N. Broad Street in Philadelphia; 1 Summer Street in Boston; 1950 N. Stemmons Freeway and 2323 Bryan Street in Dallas; and 2001 6th Street in Seattle. zColo also has the exclusive right to operate and provide colocation and interconnection services in the Meet-Me Room at 60 Hudson Street. We also have colocation facilities located in Atlanta, Ashburn, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Memphis, Miami, Nashville, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C. and nine additional locations in France. All of our facilities are network-neutral, and have ample power to meet customer needs, backup power in the form of batteries and generators, air conditioning, modern fire suppression equipment, 24/7 security and equipment monitoring, and redundant cooling capabilities. We have long-term leases with the owners of each of the buildings where we provide colocation services. Our colocation facilities total more than 520,000 square feet of billable colocation space.Underlying RightsWe have the necessary right-of-way agreements and other required rights, including state and federal government authorization, to allow us to maintain and expand our fiber networks that are located on private property and public rights-of-way, including utility poles. When we expand our network, we obtain the necessary construction permits, license agreements, permits and franchise agreements. Certain of these permits, licenses and franchises are for a limited duration. When we need to use private property, our strategy is to obtain rights-of-way under long-term contracts.6 Our Segments and ServicesWe provide two major types of products and services, which form the basis for two of our three operating segments: Physical Infrastructure and Cloud and Connectivity.  Our Other segment includes Zayo Professional Services (“ZPS”), our professional services business that provides network and technical resources to our customers.  Across our segments, we operate individual Strategic Product Groups. Each Strategic Product Group has financial accountability and decision-making authority, which promotes agility in the fast-moving markets we serve. Financial information for each of our operating segments and our domestic and foreign operations is contained in Note 16 - Segment Reporting to our consolidated financial statements. •Physical Infrastructure.    Through our Physical Infrastructure segment, we provide raw bandwidth infrastructure to customers that require more control of their internal networks. These services include dark fiber, mobile infrastructure (fiber-to-the-tower and small cell), and colocation and interconnection. Dark fiber is a physically separate and secure, private platform for dedicated bandwidth. We lease dark fiber pairs (usually two to 12 total fibers) to our customers, who “light” the fiber using their own optronics. Our mobile infrastructure services provide direct fiber connections to cell towers, small cells, hub sites, and mobile switching centers. Our datacenters offer colocation and interconnection services to our customers, who then house and power our computing and networking equipment for the purpose of aggregating and distributing data, voice, Internet, and video traffic. Strategic Product Groups within the Physical Infrastructure segment include: oZayo Dark Fiber.    Through our Dark Fiber Strategic Product Group, we provide dark fiber and related services on portions of our existing fiber network and/or newly constructed network segments. We provide dark fiber pairs to our customers, who then light the fiber using their own optronic equipment, allowing the customer to manage bandwidth according to their specific business needs. As part of our service offering, we manage and maintain the underlying fiber network for the customer. Other related services may include the installation and maintenance of building entrance fiber or riser fiber for distribution within a building. Customers include carriers and other communication service providers, ISPs, wireless service providers, major media and content companies, large enterprises, large school districts, government institutions, and other entities that have the expertise to operate their own optronics. We market and sell dark fiber-related services under long-term contracts, typically provided for terms between five and twenty years in length. Customers generally pay on a monthly basis for the fiber; however, some customers pay upfront (generally referred to as an IRU). Fiber maintenance (or O&M) services are generally billed on an annual or monthly recurring basis regardless of the timing of the payment for the fiber lease. Recurring payments are fixed, but often include automatic annual price escalators intended to compensate us for inflation. oZayo Mobile Infrastructure (“MIG”).    Our MIG Strategic Product Group provides two key services: FTT and small cell infrastructure. MIG customers are wireless carriers. Our FTT product consists of fiber-based backhaul from cellular towers to mobile switching centers. This service is generally provided via an Ethernet (in speeds of 50 Mb and above) or dark fiber service, and is used by wireless service providers to enable 3G and 4G mobile voice and data services to their customers. As of June 30, 2015, we had approximately 5,000 cellular towers on-net, and we are actively constructing fiber to over an additional 2,500. Typically, towers have multiple tenants, which provide us with the opportunity to sell services to those additional tenants. MIG’s small cell infrastructure services provide two separate sub-services. The first sub-service is neutral space and power at a small cell location (example: a light pole), similar to a tower provider. Wireless services providers purchase this service to have a physical location on which to mount their small cell antennas. The second sub-service is dark fiber backhaul from the antenna location to a mobile switching center or interim aggregation point (often a tower). Services are typically provided for terms between five and 20 years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and, in most cases, an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. Pricing is a function of the quantity of dark fiber or bandwidth consumed and the number of locations served.7  oZayo Colocation (“zColo”).    Through our zColo Strategic Product Group, we provide network-neutral colocation and interconnection services in 45 datacenter facilities across 37 markets throughout the United States and France. zColo manages more than 520,000 square feet of billable colocation space within these facilities. All of our facilities provide 24 hour per day, 365 days per year management and monitoring with physical security, fire suppression, power distribution, backup power, cooling and multiple redundant fiber connections to multiple network providers. The components of our network neutral colocation offering are: space, power, interconnection and remote technical services. We sell space in half-racks, racks, cabinets, cages, and private suites. We provide alternating current (“AC”) and direct current (“DC”) power at various levels. Our power product is supported by battery and generator back-up sources. As a network-neutral provider of colocation services, we provide our customers with interconnection services allowing customers to connect and deliver bandwidth between separate networks using fiber, Ethernet, and SONET services. We believe our interconnection offering is differentiated by our inter-building dark fiber infrastructure, allowing connectivity between and among multiple suites in major U.S. datacenters, and our Metro Interconnect product, which allows customers to interconnect to other important traffic exchange buildings within a metro market. We also offer datacenter customers outsourced technical resources through our “remote hands” product. Customers can vary by facility and include: domestic and foreign carriers, ISPs, cloud services providers, on-line gaming companies, content providers, media companies and other data-centric enterprises. Services are typically provided for terms between one and five years for a recurring monthly fee and, in many cases, an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. zColo is the exclusive operator of the Meet-Me Room at 60 Hudson Street in New York, which is one of the most critical carrier hotels in the world. •Cloud and Connectivity.    Our Cloud and Connectivity segment provides bandwidth infrastructure solutions over our metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks where we use optronics to light the fiber and our customers pay us for access based on the amount and type of bandwidth they purchase. Our cloud and connectivity services include wavelength, Ethernet, IP, SONET and cloud services. We target customers who require a minimum of 10G of bandwidth across their networks. Strategic Product Groups within the Cloud and Connectivity segment include: oZayo Wavelength Services.    Through our Wavelength Services Strategic Product Group, we provide lit bandwidth infrastructure services to customers by using optical wavelength technology. The service is provided by using DWDM optronic equipment to “multiplex” multiple channels (i.e., wavelengths) of dedicated capacity on a single fiber pair. The wavelength group provides its services in speeds of 1G, 2.5G, 10G, 40G, and 100G. Customers include carriers, financial services companies, healthcare, government institutions, education institutions and other enterprises. Services are typically provided for terms between one and five years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. oZayo Ethernet Services.    Our Ethernet Services Strategic Product Group provides lit bandwidth infrastructure services to its customers utilizing Ethernet technology. Ethernet services are offered in metro markets as well as between metro areas (intercity) in point-to-point and multi-point configurations. Unlike data transmission over a dedicated wavelength network, information transmitted over Ethernet is transferred in a packet or frame across the network. The frame enables the data to navigate across a shared infrastructure in order to reach the customer required destination. Services are provided in speeds ranging from 10Mb to 10G. Customers include carriers, financial services companies, healthcare, government institutions, education institutions and other enterprises. Services are typically provided for terms between one and five years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. oZayo Internet Protocol Services.    The Internet Protocol Strategic Product Group provides lit bandwidth infrastructure services to its customers utilizing Internet Protocol technology. IP technology transports data across multiple circuits over a shared infrastructure from the customer source to the customer required destination. Information leaving the source is divided into multiple packets and each packet traverses the network utilizing the most efficient path and means available, as determined by a network of IP routers. Packets of information may travel across different physical circuits or paths in order to reach the destination, at which point the packets are reassembled to form the complete communication. Services are generally used to exchange or access traffic on the public Internet. Services are provided in speeds ranging from 10Mb to 100G on a single customer port interface. Customers include regional telecommunications and cable carriers, ISPs, enterprises, educational institutions and content companies. Services are typically provided for terms between one and three years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases a usage-based and/or an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. Pricing is generally a function of bandwidth capacity and transport required to carry traffic from the customer location to a public Internet exchange.8  oZayo SONET Services.    Our SONET Strategic Product Group provides lit bandwidth infrastructure services to its customers utilizing SONET technology. SONET is a standardized protocol that transfers multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. SONET technology is often used to support private line services. This protocol enables transmission of voice, data and video at high speeds. SONET networks are protected, which provides for virtually instantaneous restoration of service in the event of a fiber cut or equipment failure. Services are provided in speeds ranging from DS-1 (1.54Mb) to OC-192 (10G) of capacity. Customers in this group are largely carriers. Services are typically provided for terms between one and five years for a fixed recurring monthly fee and in some cases an additional upfront, non-recurring fee. SONET is generally a more legacy product that is gradually being replaced by Ethernet, wavelength and dark fiber services. As a result, the SONET Strategic Product Group generally manages its business to maximize cash generation and deploys minimal growth capital. oZayo Cloud Services.    Zayo Cloud Services combines private cloud, public cloud and managed services in order to provide its customers infrastructure as a service (IaaS) which enables on-demand scaling and virtual computing in hybrid environments.   •Other.    Our Other segment is primarily comprised of ZPS. Through our professional services ZPS Strategic Product Group, we provide network and technical resources to customers who wish to leverage our expertise in designing, acquiring, and maintaining networks.  Services are typically provided for a term of one year for a fixed recurring monthly fee in the case of network and on an hourly basis for technical resources (usage revenue).Our OperationsNetwork Management and OperationsOur primary network operating center (“NOC”) is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma and provides 24 hour per day, 365 days per year monitoring and network surveillance. As part of our business continuity plan, our primary NOC is backed up by several regional operations centers located in Washington, D.C.; Allentown, Pennsylvania; and Butte, Montana. We continually monitor for and proactively respond to any events that negatively impact or interrupt the services that we provide to our customers. Our NOC also responds to customer network inquiries via standard customer trouble ticket procedures. Our NOC coordinates and notifies our customers of maintenance activities and is the organization responsible for ensuring that we meet our service level agreements.Information TechnologyOur Information Technology systems have been designed and built specifically for the needs of a focused bandwidth infrastructure provider primarily leveraging the salesforce.com platform. This platform was adopted at our inception and has been enhanced over time to integrate all of our acquired companies and increase functionality in every area.Our current systems’ capability is mature, and we view our application functionality as a competitive advantage in our industry. Our system is differentiated from the typical telecom industry technology solution consisting of separate and loosely integrated sales force automation, customer relationship management, provisioning, mapping, inventory, financial, provisioning and other systems with multiple, sometimes conflicting databases.We have also developed within our salesforce.com platform a proprietary capability we call Tranzact. Tranzact is a set of tools and processes designed to enhance the speed and simplicity of procuring bandwidth infrastructure services. We believe Tranzact will further increase our competitive advantage in delivering bandwidth infrastructure solutions.We have a fully implemented business continuity and disaster recovery plan that provides near real-time data access from physically diverse datacenters (Dallas and Washington, D.C.). We further protect our data with off-site data storage practices.Our Sales and Marketing OrganizationOur business primarily engages in direct sales through our sales organization, consisting of 134 sales representatives as of June 30, 2015. Each of these sales representatives is part of an enterprise or carrier focused sales team led by a sales director whose team is responsible for meeting a quarterly bookings quota. The sales organization sells services across all our Strategic Product Groups. The sales representatives are directly supported by sales management, engineering, solutions engineering and marketing staff.9 The sales organization is organized into direct sales channels that generally align around both region and customer. Each of these channels maintains dedicated sales and solutions engineering support resources. There are four direct sales channels in the United States who are geographically focused supporting regional carriers and medium to large enterprise customers, particularly in the healthcare, education, internet content, media and financial sectors.  Within those channels there are dedicated teams focused on our national wireline and wireless customers across all geographies.   Within Europe, there are direct outside sales channels focused on similar European-based customers. In addition to the direct channels discussed above, an indirect sales channel manages our channel partner program with various high value telecom sales agents. Finally, we have developed a group of sales overlay teams to focus on leveraging our infrastructure assets for the benefit of specific industry verticals and geographies.Our direct sales force is compensated through a unique system relative to typical industry practices. Sales staff are compensated through salary and incentive compensation, which is comprised of cash and equity.  Incentive compensation is achieved based upon the net present value (“NPV”) of the contracted services sold, the incremental revenue related to contracted services sold and the effective management of churn related to the accounts they manage. We believe that this compensation system best aligns the interests of our salespeople, management and our stockholders. It also is an example of the financial philosophy and culture that we have developed since our inception.Separate from the sales groups, we have a corporate marketing group that is responsible for our web presence, customer facing mapping tools, marketing campaigns, and public relations. The sales organization is further supported by product management teams that are organized into the Strategic Product Groups. Our CustomersOur customers generally have a significant and growing need for the bandwidth infrastructure services that we provide. Our customer base consists of wireless service providers, carriers and other communication service providers, media and content companies (including cable and satellite video providers), and other bandwidth-intensive businesses in the education, healthcare, financial services, governmental and technology entities. Our largest single customer, based on recurring revenue, accounted for approximately 6% of our revenue during the year ended June 30, 2015, and total revenues from our top ten customers accounted for approximately 27% of our revenue during the same period. These customers are multinational organizations with substantial liquidity and access to capital, and whose bandwidth needs are mission-critical to their own businesses and strategies. While these large customers generally have a finite set of master contracts with us, they procure a large volume of individual services with us, each of which has its own service detail and term.The majority of our customers sign Master Service Agreements (“MSAs”) that contain standard terms and conditions including service level agreements, required response intervals, indemnification, default, force majeure, assignment and notification, limitation of liability, confidentiality and other key terms and conditions. Most MSAs also contain appendices that contain information that is specific to each of the services that we provide. The MSAs either have exhibits that contain service orders or, alternatively, terms for services ordered are set forth in a separate service order. Each service order sets forth the minimum contract duration, the monthly recurring charge, and the non-recurring charges.Our Business StrategyIn pursuit of our mission, our Business Strategy includes the following key elements: •Focus on Bandwidth Infrastructure.    We expect that bandwidth needs for mobile applications, cloud-based computing, and machine-to-machine connectivity will continue to grow with the continued adoption of bandwidth-intensive devices, as well as the escalating demand for Internet-delivered video. We focus on providing high-bandwidth infrastructure solutions, which we believe are essential in the consumption and delivery of bandwidth-intensive applications and services by enterprise customers and communications service providers. We believe our disciplined approach to providing these critical services to our targeted customers enables us to offer a high level of customer service, while at the same time being responsive to changes in the marketplace. •Target Large Consumers of Bandwidth.    Our asset base and product suite are geared for large consumers of bandwidth with high connectivity requirements. The majority of our customers require more than 10G of bandwidth; many of our customers require multiple terabytes of bandwidth. Our revenue base is generally characterized by customers with a high bandwidth spend, consisting of a large number of individual services and increasing bandwidth infrastructure service demand. Tailoring our operations around these products, services and customers allows us to operate efficiently and meet these large consumers’ requirements for mission-critical infrastructure.10  •Leverage Our Extensive Asset Base by Selling Services on Our Network.    Targeting our sales efforts on services that utilize our existing fiber networks and datacenters enables us to limit our reliance on third-party service providers. We believe this in turn produces high incremental margins, which helps us expand consolidated margins, achieve attractive returns on the capital we invest, and realize significant levered free cash flow. We also believe this enables us to provide our customers with a superior level of customer service due to the relative ease in responding to customer service inquiries over one contiguous fiber network. Our existing networks enable us to sell additional bandwidth to our existing customers as their capacity needs grow. •Continue to Expand Our Infrastructure Assets.    Our ability to rapidly add network capacity to meet the growing requirements of our customers is an important component of our value proposition. We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our network footprint where supporting customer contracts provide an attractive return on our investment. The expansion of our network footprint also provides the ancillary benefit of bringing other potential customer locations within reach. We design our networks with additional capacity so that increasing bandwidth capacity can be deployed economically and efficiently. A significant portion of our capital expenditures are success-based. •Leverage Our Existing Relationships and Assets to Innovate.    We believe we possess a unique set of assets and management systems designed to deliver customer solutions tailored to specific trends we observe in the marketplace. Our high-energy, entrepreneurial culture fosters employee innovation on an ongoing basis in response to specific customer requirements. Furthermore, we plan to continue to commit capital to new lines of infrastructure businesses that leverage our existing assets. For example, we are expanding into small cell infrastructure services provided to wireless services providers. These services entail us providing dark fiber and related services from a small cell location back to a mobile switching center. We provide the fiber-based transport over our existing and/or newly constructed fiber networks. In addition, we provide network-neutral space and power for wireless service providers to co-locate their small cell antennas and ancillary equipment. •Intelligently Expand Through Acquisitions.    We have made 34 acquisitions to date for an aggregate purchase price, net of cash, of $4.6 billion. We believe we have consistently demonstrated an ability to acquire and effectively integrate companies, realize cost synergies, and organically grow revenue post-acquisition. Acquisitions have the ability to increase the scale of our operations, which in turn affords us the ability to expand our operating leverage, extend our network reach, and broaden our customer base.  We believe our ability to realize significant cost synergies through acquisitions provides us with a competitive advantage in future consolidation opportunities within our industry. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities and are regularly involved in acquisition discussions. We will evaluate these opportunities based on a number of criteria, including the quality of the infrastructure assets, the fit within our existing businesses, the opportunity to expand our network, and the opportunity to create value through the realization of cost synergies.Our Competitive StrengthsWe believe the following are among our core competitive strengths and enable us to differentiate ourselves in the markets we serve: •Unique Bandwidth Infrastructure Assets.    We believe replicating our extensive metro, regional, and long-haul fiber assets would be difficult given the significant capital, time, permitting, and expertise required. Our fiber spans over 85,500 route miles and 6,700,000 fiber miles (representing an average of 78 fibers per route), served 320 geographic markets in the United States and Europe, and connect to approximately 18,000 buildings. The majority of the markets that we serve and buildings to which we connect have few other networks capable of providing similar high-bandwidth infrastructure and connectivity solutions, which we believe provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage in these markets, and positions us as a mission-critical infrastructure supplier to the largest users of bandwidth. We believe that the vast majority of customers using our network, including our lit bandwidth, fiber-to-the-tower, and dark fiber customers, choose our services due to the quality and reach of our network, and the ability our network gives us to innovate and scale with their growing bandwidth needs. Additionally, we operate 45 datacenter facilities, which are located in eight of the most important carrier hotels in the U.S. and France. This collective presence, combined with our high network density, creates a network effect that helps us retain existing customers and attract new customers. From July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2015, exclusive of acquisitions and stimulus grant reimbursements, we have invested approximately $1.2 billion of capital in our networks, including expansion and maintenance expenditures.11  •Strong Revenue Growth, Visibility, and Durability.    We have consistently grown our organic revenue, as gross installed revenue has exceeded churn processed in every quarter since we began reporting in March 2010. We believe our exposure to the enduring trend of increasing bandwidth consumption combined with our focused execution have allowed us to achieve this consistent growth. We typically provide our bandwidth infrastructure services for a fixed monthly recurring fee under multi-year contracts. Our contract terms range from one year to twenty years. Our customers use our bandwidth infrastructure to support their mission-critical networks and applications. The switching costs and effort required to replace our services can be high, particularly for the services within our Physical Infrastructure segment, given the criticality of our services and the potential cost and disruption. We believe that increasing bandwidth needs combined with the mission-critical nature of our services provided under multi-year contracts create strong revenue growth, visibility, and durability, which support our decision-making abilities and financial stability. We believe that our industry’s high barriers to entry, our economies of scale and scope and customer switching costs contribute to our strong financial performance. •Customer Service and Ability to Innovate for Our Customers.    Our sales and product professionals work closely with potential and existing customers to design tailored high-bandwidth connectivity solutions across our Strategic Product Groups to meet specific, varying, and evolving customer needs. We are focused on delivering high-quality, reliable service to our customers. We achieve this by leveraging our contiguous network to expand with our customers as they seek to build scale, coverage, and/or performance. Additionally, our focus on serving the largest and most sophisticated users of bandwidth keeps our sales, engineering, and service organizations attuned to the latest technologies, architectures, and solutions that our customers may seek to implement. We believe our willingness to innovate for our customers and our dedication to customer service help establish our position as an important infrastructure supplier and allow us to attract new customers and businesses, sell an increasing amount of services to our existing customers, and reduce customer turnover. •Strategic, Operational and Financial Transparency Excellence.    As part of our strategy to serve the largest users of bandwidth, we have completed and integrated 34 acquisitions to date. Our acquired assets have been combined to create a contiguous network with the ability to provision and maintain local, regional, national, or international high-bandwidth connections across our Strategic Product Groups. Our entire network, sales and churn activity, installation pipeline, NPV commission plans, and all customer contracts are managed through an integrated operating and reporting platform, which gives management strong visibility into the business and improves our ability to drive return-maximizing decisions throughout the organization. Our focus on operational and financial transparency not only allows us to be very nimble in attacking various market opportunities, but also provides us the ability to deliver disclosure that our stockholders and other stakeholders can use to accurately judge management’s performance from a capital allocation, financial, and operational perspective. •Financially Focused and Entrepreneurial Culture.    Virtually all operational and financial decisions we make are driven by the standard of maximizing the value of our enterprise. Our sales commission plans use an NPV-based approach with the goal of encouraging the proper behavior within our sales force, and our Strategic Product Groups are held to group level equity internal rate of return (“IRR”) targets set by management. To align individual behaviors with stockholder objectives, equity compensation is used throughout the Company, and our compensation plans include a larger equity component than we believe is standard in our industry.  In addition to striving for industry-leading operational and growth outcomes to drive value creation, we are prepared to use debt capacity to enhance stockholder returns, but not at the expense of other stakeholders and only at levels we believe are in the long-term interests of the Company, our customers, and our stockholders. Finally, our owners’ manual, mission, and investor transparency all serve to enhance cultural alignment across the Company and our stockholders. •Experienced Management with Unique Leadership Approach.    We have assembled an experienced management team that we believe is well-qualified to lead our Company and execute our strategy. Our management team has substantial industry experience in managing and designing fiber networks and network-neutral colocation and interconnection facilities and in selling and marketing bandwidth infrastructure services. In addition, our management team has significant experience in acquiring and integrating bandwidth infrastructure and assets. Our management team is a cohesive unit with a common history that in many cases precedes the Company’s founding. We also believe that our approach to leadership - operationally, financially, culturally - is unique in our industry and differentiates us from our competitors.12 Our Competition Physical Infrastructure ServicesGiven the requirement to own the underlying bandwidth infrastructure assets (e.g., fiber networks and datacenter facilities) in order to provide physical infrastructure services, the competitive environment tends to be less intensive for these products and the barriers to entry high. The degree of competition and parties in competition vary by physical infrastructure sub-service and by individual market and fiber route. The competitive situation by service is described as follows:Dark Fiber.    Competition in dark fiber services tends to be less intense than for lit bandwidth infrastructure services primarily because a provider must predominantly own and operate a high count fiber network covering a substantial portion of the geographical demand in order to compete for a customer’s business. The uniqueness, density and depth (i.e., high fiber count) of our metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks is therefore a key differentiating factor. In addition, given that providing dark fiber services often includes some degree of network expansion, dark fiber providers must also have internal project management expertise and access to capital to execute on the expansion aspect of the business. Due to the custom nature of most dark fiber opportunities, many larger lit bandwidth infrastructure providers do not actively market dark fiber as a product, even if they own fiber networks in the desired geographies. As a result, competition is often more limited in the dark fiber services market and highly dependent on the local (even sub-market) supply and demand environment. Given this dynamic and the generally longer contractual term of dark fiber services, dark fiber pricing tends to be more inflationary in nature.Specific dark fiber competitors vary significantly based on geography, and often a particular solution can be provided by only one to three carriers that have sufficient fiber in place in the desired area or route. These competitors tend to fall into two categories: first, privately owned regional bandwidth infrastructure providers with a similar degree of focus (e.g., Lightower and Sunesys) and second, single market dark fiber providers with market and fiber construction expertise (e.g., DQE Communications and Edison Carrier Solutions).Mobile Infrastructure.    Competition in mobile infrastructure services tends to mirror dark fiber services because of the need to own and operate an expansive and deep metro fiber network in order to compete. Given the frequent need to expand upon an existing fiber footprint in order to access additional cell towers and small cell locations, project management expertise and access to capital is also a key competitive factor. One additional criterion is that wireless carriers prefer to work with a more finite group of mobile infrastructure providers on either a metro or regional geographic basis. As a result, the competitive group tends to match that of dark fiber services, with the addition of two competitive groups. First, local cable providers and ILECs who will often break from their retail and small enterprise core focus to compete for FTT business, often as a result of legacy copper or coaxial-based services provided to these towers. Second, microwave backhaul providers who focus on more remote or rural towers that have lesser bandwidth needs that they can serve with less capital-intensive (and less bandwidth-capable) microwave solutions at a lower total cost. Examples of these additional mobile infrastructure competitors are Comcast, Time Warner Cable, CenturyLink, PEG Bandwidth, Conterra and TTMI.Colocation.    The market for our colocation and interconnection services is very competitive. We compete based on price, quality of service, network-neutrality, breadth of network connectivity options, type and quantity of customers in our datacenters, and location. We compete against both large, public colocation providers who have significant enterprise values, and privately-held, well-funded companies. Some of our competitors have longer-standing customer relationships and significantly greater access to capital, which may enable them to materially increase datacenter space, and therefore lower overall market pricing for such services. Several of our competitors have much larger colocation facilities in the markets where we operate. Others operate globally and are able to attract a customer base that values and requires global reach and scale.These focused interconnection and colocation service providers include:  Equinix, Inc., The Telx Group, Inc., Terremark Worldwide, Inc. (a Verizon Communications, Inc. subsidiary), Coresite, Savvis, Inc. (a CenturyLink, Inc. subsidiary), and Cologix. These companies offer similar services and operate in similar markets to us.Cloud and Connectivity We believe that some of the key factors that influence our customers’ selection of us as their cloud and connectivity services provider are our ability to provide an on-net service that utilizes our fiber network on an end-to-end basis, the ability to more quickly implement a complex custom solution to meet customers’ needs, the price of the service provided, and the ongoing customer service provided.13 Generally, price competition varies depending on the size and location of the market. We face direct price competition when there are other fiber-based carriers who have networks that serve the same customers and geographies that we do. The specific competitors vary significantly based on geography, and often a particular solution can be provided by only one to three carriers that have comparable fiber in place. Typically, these competitors are large, well-capitalized ILECs, such as AT&T Inc., CenturyLink, Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc., or are publicly traded communications service providers that provide bandwidth infrastructure, such as Level 3 Communications, Inc. or Cogent Communications. In certain geographies, privately-held companies such as Lightower and Southern Light, can also offer comparable fiber-based solutions.  On occasion, the price for high-bandwidth infrastructure services is too high compared with the cost of lower-speed, copper-based telecom services. We believe that price competition will continue where our competitors have comparable existing fiber networks. Some of our competitors have long-standing customer relationships, very large enterprise values, and significant access to capital.OtherWe do not own any significant intellectual property, nor do we spend a material amount on research and development. Our working capital requirements and expansion needs have been satisfied to date through equity contributions, debt issuances, proceeds from our initial public offering (“IPO”) and follow on equity offering in March 2015, and cash provided by operating activities.Regulatory MattersOur operations require that certain of our subsidiaries hold licenses, certificates, and/or other regulatory authorizations from the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), state Public Utilities Commissions (“PUCs”), European telecommunications regulators such as Ofcom and ARCEP and other foreign regulators, all of which we have obtained and maintain in the normal course of our business. The FCC, State PUCs and foreign regulators generally have the power to modify or terminate a carrier’s authority to provide regulated wireline services for failure to comply with certain federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, and may impose fines or other penalties for violations of the same. The State PUCs typically have similar powers with respect to the intrastate services that we provide under their jurisdiction. In addition, we are required to submit periodic reports to the FCC, State PUCs, and foreign regulators documenting interstate, intrastate and foreign revenue, among other data, for fee assessments and general regulatory governance, and in some states are required to file tariffs of our rates, terms, and conditions of service. In order to engage in certain transactions in these jurisdictions, including changes of control, the encumbrance of certain assets, the issuance of securities, the incurrence of indebtedness, the guarantee of indebtedness of other entities, including subsidiaries of ours, and the transfer of our assets, we are required to provide notice and/or obtain prior approval from certain of these governmental agencies. The construction of additions to our current fiber network is also subject to certain governmental permitting and licensing requirements.In addition, our business is subject to various other regulations at the federal, state, local and international levels. These regulations affect the way we can conduct our business and our costs of doing so. However, we believe, based on our examination of such existing and potential new regulations being considered in ongoing FCC, State PUC and European and other foreign telecommunications proceedings, that such regulations will not have a significant impact on us.Website Access and Important Investor InformationWe file periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.Risks Related to our BusinessWe have consistently generated net losses since our inception and such losses may continue in the future.We have consistently generated net losses since our inception and such losses may continue in the future. These net losses primarily have been driven by significant depreciation, amortization, interest expense, and stock-based compensation. During Fiscal 2015, we had depreciation and amortization expense of $406.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $200.7 million, and interest expense of $214.0 million. At June 30, 2015, we had $3,785.1 million of total debt (including capital lease obligations and before any unamortized discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs). We cannot assure you that we will generate net income in the future.Since our inception, we have used more cash than we have generated from operations, and we may continue to do so.Since our inception, we have consistently consumed our entire positive cash flow generated from operating activities with our investing activities. Our investing activities have consisted principally of the acquisition of businesses as well as material additions to property and equipment. We have funded the excess of cash used in investing activities over cash provided by operating activities with proceeds from equity contributions and equity and debt issuances.We intend to continue to invest in expanding our fiber network and our business and pursuing acquisitions that we believe provide an attractive return on our capital. These investments may continue to exceed the amount of cash flow available from operations after debt service requirements. To the extent that our investments exceed our cash flow from operations, we plan to rely on potential future debt or equity issuances, which could increase interest expense or dilute the interest of our stockholders, as well as cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain or continue to have access to sufficient capital on reasonable terms, or at all, to successfully grow our business.15 We are highly dependent on our management team and other key employees, many of whom own equity that was previously illiquid but became liquid as a result of our IPO.We expect that our continued success will largely depend upon the efforts and abilities of members of our management team and other key employees. Our success also depends upon our ability to identify, attract, develop, and retain qualified employees. None of the executive management team except for Mr. Caruso is bound by an employment agreement with us. If we lost members of our management team or other key employees, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. As announced on December 26, 2014, Dan Caruso, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. Mr. Caruso was diagnosed with and treated for prostate cancer in 2013 and recent tests have revealed that trace amounts of the cancer remain. Mr. Caruso is continuing to fulfill his responsibilities as the Company’s CEO and Chairman on a full-time basis with no interruption. At this time, no organizational changes related to Mr. Caruso’s cancer treatment are planned or anticipated. All of our officers and many of our key management and employees have had a significant portion of their compensation paid in equity. The liquidity provided by our IPO and subsequent equity offerings in many cases represents material wealth of our officers and key management employees that may impact retention and focus of existing key employees.Our revenue is relatively concentrated among a small number of customers, and the loss of any of these customers could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Our largest single customer, based on recurring revenue, accounted for approximately 6% of our revenue during Fiscal 2015, and total revenues from our top ten customers accounted for approximately 27% of our revenue during Fiscal 2015. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. Many of these customers are also competitors for some or all of our service offerings. Our customer contracts typically have terms of one to twenty years. Our customers may elect not to renew these contracts. Furthermore, our customer contracts are terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract. We may face increased competition and pricing pressure as our customer contracts become subject to renewal. Our customers may negotiate renewal of their contracts at lower rates, for fewer services or for shorter terms. Many of our customers are in the telecommunications industry, which is undergoing consolidation. To the extent that two or more of our customers combine, they may be able to use their greater size to negotiate lower prices from us and may purchase fewer services from us, especially if their networks overlap. If we are unable to successfully renew our customer contracts on commercially acceptable terms, or if our customer contracts are terminated, our business could suffer.We are also subject to credit risk associated with the concentration of our accounts receivable from our key customers. If one or more of these customers were to become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts receivable or incur impairment charges.We have numerous customer orders for connections, including contracts with multiple national wireless carriers to build out additional towers. If we are unable to satisfy new orders or build our network according to contractually specified deadlines, we may incur penalties or suffer the loss of revenue.Future acquisitions are a component of our strategic plan, and will include integration and other risks that could harm our business.We have grown rapidly and intend to continue to acquire complementary businesses and assets, and some of these acquisitions may be large or in new geographic areas where we do not currently operate. This exposes us to the risk that when we evaluate a potential acquisition target we over-estimate the target’s value and, as a result, pay too much for it. We also cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully integrate acquired assets or the operations of the acquired entity with our existing operations. Businesses and assets that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers. While we usually require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive, such indemnification is often limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses.  As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties. In addition, the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with acquired properties and entities may exceed our expectations, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.16 We have previously engaged in and may continue to engage in large acquisitions, such as the AboveNet and Latisys acquisitions, which could be much more difficult to integrate. Difficulties with integration could cause material customer disruption and dissatisfaction, which could in turn increase churn and reduce new sales. Additionally, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses in a manner that permits us to realize the cost synergies we anticipate in the time, manner, or amount we currently expect, or at all. Our actual cost synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities, and efficiency and operational benefits resulting from any acquisition may be lower and may take longer to realize than we currently expect.  In addition, some recently acquired companies have had Adjusted EBITDA margins that were lower than ours, which had a negative impact on our incremental margins.  Future acquisitions may have a similar effect.We may incur additional debt or issue additional equity to assist in the funding of these potential transactions, which may increase our leverage and/or dilute the interest of our stockholders. Further, additional transactions could cause disruption of our ongoing business and divert management’s attention from the management of daily operations to the closing and integration of the acquired business. Acquisitions also involve other operational and financial risks such as: •increased demand on our existing employees and management related to the increase in the size of the business and the possible distraction from our existing business due to the acquisition; •loss of key employees and salespeople of the acquired business; •liabilities of the acquired business, both unknown and known at the time of the consummation of the acquisition; •discovery that the financial statements we relied on to buy a business were incorrect; •expenses associated with the integration of the operations of the acquired business; •the possibility of future impairment, write-downs of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquired business; •finding that the services and operations of the acquired business do not meet the level of quality of those of our existing services and operations; and •recognizing that the internal controls of the acquired business were inadequate.We are growing rapidly and may not maintain or efficiently manage our growth.We have rapidly grown our company through acquisitions of companies and assets as well as expansion of our own network and the acquisition of new customers through our own sales efforts. We also intend to continue to grow our company, including through acquisitions, some of which may be large. Customers can be reluctant to switch providers of bandwidth services because it can involve substantial expense and technical difficulty. That can make it harder for us to acquire new customers through our own sales efforts. Our expansion may place strains on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent upon our ability to: •expand, develop, and retain an effective sales force and other qualified personnel; •maintain the quality of our operations and our service offerings; •attract customers to switch from their current providers to us in spite of the costs associated with switching providers; •maintain and enhance our system of internal controls to ensure timely and accurate reporting; and •expand our operational information systems in order to support our growth, including integrating new customers without disruption.Service level agreements in our customer agreements could subject us to liability or the loss of revenue.Our contracts with customers typically contain service guarantees (including network availability) and service delivery date targets, which could enable customers to claim credits and, under certain conditions, terminate their agreements. Our inability to meet our service level guarantees could adversely affect our revenue. In Fiscal 2015, lost revenue from failure to meet service level guarantees was approximately $0.9 million. While we typically have carve-outs for force majeure events, many events, such as fiber cuts, equipment failure and third-party vendors being unable to meet their underlying commitments with us, could impact our ability to meet our service level agreements.17 Any failure of our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions.Our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable service. The services we provide are subject to failure resulting from numerous factors, including: •human error; •power loss; •improper building maintenance by the landlords of the buildings in which our datacenters are located; •physical or electronic security breaches; •fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, and other natural disasters; •water damage; •the effect of war, terrorism, and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide; and •sabotage and vandalism.Problems within our network or our datacenters, whether within our control or the control of our landlords or other third-party providers, could result in service interruptions or equipment damage. As current and future customers increase their power usage in our facilities over time, the remaining available power for future customers could limit our ability to grow our business and increase occupancy rates or network density within our existing facilities.  Accordingly, we may not be able to efficiently upgrade or change these systems to meet new demands without incurring significant costs that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In the past, we have experienced disruptions in our network attributed to equipment failure and power outages. Although such disruptions have been remedied and the network has been stabilized, there can be no assurance that similar disruptions will not occur in the future. Given the service level agreement obligations we typically have in our customer contracts, such disruptions could result in customer credits; however, we cannot assume that our customers will accept these credits as compensation in the future, and we may face additional liability or loss of customers.We use franchises, licenses, permits, rights-of-way, conduit leases, fiber agreements, and property leases, which could be canceled or not renewed.We must maintain rights-of-way, franchises, and other permits from railroads, utilities, state highway authorities, local governments, transit authorities, and others to operate our owned fiber network. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining these rights-of-way agreements or obtaining future agreements on acceptable terms. Some of these agreements are short-term or revocable at will, and we cannot assure you that we will continue to have access to existing rights-of-way after they have expired or terminated. If a material portion of these agreements are terminated or are not renewed, we might be forced to abandon our networks. In order to operate our networks, we must also maintain fiber leases and IRU agreements that we have with public and private entities. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew those fiber routes on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew those fiber routes on favorable terms, we may face increased costs or reduced revenues.In order to expand our network to new locations, we often need to obtain additional rights-of-way, franchises, and other permits. Our failure to obtain these rights in a prompt and cost-effective manner may prevent us from expanding our network, which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and could expose us to liabilities.If we lose or are unable to renew key real property leases where we have located our POPs, it could adversely affect our services and increase our costs, as we would be required to restructure our network and move our POPs.We are required to maintain, repair, upgrade, and replace our network and our facilities, the cost of which could materially impact our results and our failure to do so could irreparably harm our business.Our business requires that we maintain, repair, upgrade, and periodically replace our facilities and networks. This requires management time and capital expenditures. In the event that we fail to maintain, repair, upgrade, or replace essential portions of our network or facilities, it could lead to a material degradation in the level of service that we provide to our customers. Our networks can be damaged in a number of ways, including by other parties engaged in construction close to our network facilities. In the event of such damage, we will be required to incur expenses to repair the network. We could be subject to significant network repair and replacement expenses in the event a terrorist attack or a natural disaster damages our network. Further, the operation of our network requires the coordination and integration of sophisticated and highly specialized hardware and software. Our failure to maintain or properly operate this can lead to degradations or interruptions in customer service. Our failure to provide proper customer service could result in claims from our customers, early termination of contracts, and damage our reputation.18 Our debt level could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business prospects and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness. In the future, we may incur substantially more indebtedness, which could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.As of June 30, 2015, our total debt (including capital lease obligations and before any unamortized discounts, premiums or debt issuance costs) was $3,785.1 million, primarily consisting of our subsidiary, Zayo Group, LLC’s (“ZGL”) $1,430.0 million of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “2023 Unsecured Notes”), $325.6 million of 10.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “2020 Secured Notes”) and $350.0 million of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the “2025 Unsecured Notes”, collectively with the 2023 Unsecured Notes and the 2020 Secured Notes, the “Notes”), $1,646.8 million  senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and $32.7 million in capital lease obligations. In addition, ZGL has a $450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolver,” and collectively with the Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facilities”), of which $440.8 million was available at June 30, 2015, subject to certain conditions. Subject to the limitations set forth in the indentures (the “Indentures”) governing the Notes and the agreement governing the Credit Facilities (the “Credit Agreement”), ZGL may incur additional indebtedness (including additional first lien obligations) in the future. If new indebtedness is added to our current levels of indebtedness, the related risks that we now face in light of our current debt level, including our possible inability to service our debt, could intensify.  Our level of debt could have important consequences, including the following: •making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements; •requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general business activities; •limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other activities; •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; •increasing our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; •placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors; and •preventing us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes tendered to ZGL upon the occurrence of certain changes of control, which would constitute a default under the Indentures.Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, which are reflected in our cash flows from operating activities, during the year ended June 30, 2015 was $191.2 million, and represented 32% of our cash flows from operating activities. Excluding our aggregate redemptions of $924.4 million of notes in December 2014 and March 2015 and Term Loan Facility repayment of $344.5 million in May 2015, we also made cash payments related to principal payments on our debt obligations (including capital leases) during the year ended June 30, 2015 of $23.1 million, which are reflected in our cash flows from financing activities, and represented 4% of our cash flows from operating activities during the period.We may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations.Our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. A range of economic, competitive, business, regulatory, and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt. Many of these factors, such as economic and financial conditions in our industry and the U.S. or the global economy, or competitive initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control.If we do not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as: •reducing or delaying capital investments; •raising additional capital; •refinancing or restructuring our debt; and •selling assets.We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that implementing any such alternative financing plans would allow us to meet our debt obligations.19 If ZGL is unable to meet its debt service obligations, it would be in default under the terms of the Indentures and the Credit Agreement, permitting acceleration of the amounts due on the Notes and under the Credit Agreement and eliminating our ability to draw on the Revolver. If the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities, the Notes, or other future indebtedness were to be accelerated, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy.Our debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies, and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.The Indentures and the Credit Facilities each contain, and agreements governing future debt issuances may contain, covenants that restrict ZGL’s ability to, among other things: •incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; •pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to any equity interests or make certain investments or other restricted payments; •create liens; •sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; •incur restrictions on the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to it; •consolidate or merge with or into other companies or transfer all, or substantially all, of its assets; •engage in transactions with affiliates; •engage in business other than telecommunications; and •enter into sale and leaseback transactions.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we may conduct our business, and as a result we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. The ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement and the Indentures may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, ZGL’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios, or tests in the Credit Agreement, the Indentures, or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under the Credit Facilities, the Indentures or our future indebtedness, which if not cured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, the Credit Facilities require ZGL to comply with specified financial ratios, including ratios regarding total leverage and secured leverage. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. These restrictions limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs, or otherwise constrain our activities or business plans. They also may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions, or engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.A breach of any of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, in any future credit agreement or the Indentures or ZGL’s inability to comply with the financial ratios could result in an event of default, which would allow the lenders to declare all borrowings outstanding to be due and payable or to terminate the ability to borrow under the Revolver. If the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities, the Notes or other future indebtedness were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed, including the Notes. In such a situation, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy.Our future tax liabilities are not predictable or controllable. If we become subject to increased levels of taxation, our financial condition and operations could be negatively impacted.We provide telecommunication and other services in multiple jurisdictions across the United States and Europe and are, therefore, subject to multiple sets of complex and varying tax laws and rules. We cannot predict the amount of future tax liabilities to which we may become subject. Any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of our operations or due to legislative or regulatory changes would be adverse to us. In addition, we may become subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. It is possible that certain tax positions taken by us could result in tax liabilities for us. While we believe that our current provisions for taxes are reasonable and appropriate, we cannot assure you that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued or that we will not identify additional exposures in the future.20 We cannot assure you whether, when or in what amounts we will be able to use our net operating losses, or when they will be depleted.At June 30, 2015, we had approximately $1,145.2 million of federal net operating losses (“NOLs”), which relate primarily to prior acquisitions. Under certain circumstances, these NOLs can be used to offset our future federal and certain taxable income. If we experience an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury regulations at a time when our market capitalization is below a certain level, our ability to use the NOLs could be substantially limited. This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the NOLs, thus accelerating cash tax payments or causing NOLs to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of the NOLs.Furthermore, transactions that we enter into, as well as transactions by existing or future 5% stockholders that we do not participate in, could cause us to incur an “ownership change,” which could prevent us from fully utilizing our NOLs to reduce our federal income taxes. These limitations could cause us not to pursue otherwise favorable acquisitions and other transactions involving our capital stock, or could reduce the net benefits to be realized from any such transactions. Despite this, we expect to use substantially all of these NOLs and certain other deferred tax attributes as an offset to our federal future taxable income, although the timing of that use will depend upon our future earnings and future tax circumstances. If and when our NOLs are fully utilized, we expect that the amount of our cash flow dedicated to the payment of federal taxes will increase substantially.We may be subject to interest rate risk and increasing interest rates may increase our interest expense.Borrowings under each of the Credit Facilities bear, and our future indebtedness may bear, interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease.The international operations of our business expose us to risks that could materially and adversely affect the business.We have operations and investments outside of the United States, as well as rights to undersea cable capacity extending to other countries, that expose us to risks inherent in international operations. These include: •general economic, social and political conditions; •the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; •tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those in the U.S.; •foreign currency exchange rates may fluctuate, which could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our international assets and investments; •foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; •difficulties and costs of compliance with foreign laws and regulations that impose restrictions on our investments and operations, with penalties for noncompliance, including loss of licenses and monetary fines; •difficulties in obtaining licenses or interconnection arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all; and •changes in U.S. laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment.We may as part of our expansion strategy increase our exposure to international investments and operations.Our international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of the U.S. and many foreign countries, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.We are subject to a variety of laws regarding our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and regulations issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and various foreign governmental agencies. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Actual or alleged violations of these laws could lead to enforcement actions and financial penalties that could result in substantial costs.21 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. We have created and implemented a program for compliance with anti-bribery laws. Because our anti-bribery internal control policies and procedures have been recently implemented, we may have increased exposure to reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third-party intermediaries. Violations of these anti-bribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our international operations expose us to currency risk.We conduct a portion of our business using the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. Appreciation of the U.S. Dollar adversely affects our consolidated revenue. For example, the U.S. Dollar has appreciated significantly against the Euro in recent periods.  Since we tend to incur costs in the same currency in which those operations realize revenue, the effect on operating income and operating cash flow is largely mitigated. However, if the U.S. Dollar continues to appreciate significantly, future revenues, operating income and operating cash flows could be materially affected.We may be vulnerable to security breaches that could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operations.Despite security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, distributed denial of service, and other security breaches. An attack on or security breach of our network could result in interruption or cessation of services, our inability to meet our service level commitments, and potentially compromise customer data transmitted over our network. We cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented, resulting in network failures or interruptions that could impact our network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operational results. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against such threats. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose customers. Any such events could result in legal claims or penalties, disruption in operations, misappropriation of sensitive data, damage to our reputation, and/or costly response measures, which could adversely affect our business.Risks Related to Our IndustryWe could face increased competition from companies in the telecommunications and media industries that currently do not focus on bandwidth infrastructure.Many of our competitors in the bandwidth infrastructure space are other focused bandwidth infrastructure providers that operate on a regional or local basis. In some cases we also compete with communications service providers who also own certain infrastructure assets and make them available to customers as an infrastructure service. These communication service providers include ILECs, such as AT&T and Verizon, and cable television companies, such as Comcast.Some of these competitors have greater financial, managerial, sales and marketing, and research and development resources than we do and are able to promote their brands with significantly larger budgets. Most of them are also our customers. If ILECs and cable television companies focus on providing bandwidth infrastructure, it could have a material adverse effect on us. A few of these competitors also have significant fiber assets that they principally employ in the provision of their communications services. If any of these competitors with greater resources and/or significant fiber assets chose to focus those resources on bandwidth infrastructure, our ability to compete in the bandwidth infrastructure industry could be negatively impacted. To the extent that communication service providers, cable television companies, and other media companies choose to distribute their content over their own networks that could reduce demand for our services. Additionally, significant new entrants into the bandwidth services industry would increase supply, which could cause prices for our services to decline.22 Consolidation among companies in the telecommunications and cable television industries could further strengthen our competitors and adversely impact our business.The telecommunications and cable television industries are intensely competitive and continue to undergo significant consolidation. There are many reasons for consolidation in these industries, including the desire for communications and cable television companies to acquire network assets in regions where they currently have no or insufficient amounts of owned network infrastructure. The consolidation within the industry may cause customers to disconnect services to move them to their own networks, or consolidate buying with other bandwidth infrastructure providers. Additionally, consolidation in the industry could further strengthen our competitors, give them greater financial resources and geographic reach, and allow them to put additional pressure on prices for bandwidth infrastructure services.Certain of our services are subject to regulation that could change or otherwise impact us in an adverse manner.Communications services are subject to domestic and international regulation at the federal, state, and local levels. These regulations affect our business and our existing and potential competitors. Our electronic communications services and electronic communications networks in Europe and elsewhere are subject to regulatory oversight by national communications regulators, such as the United Kingdom’s Office of Communications (“Ofcom”) and France’s Autorité de Régulation des Communications Electroniques et des Postes (“ARCEP”).  In addition, in the United States, both the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the state public utility commissions or similar regulatory authorities (the “State PUCs”) typically require us to file periodic reports, pay various regulatory fees and assessments, and to comply with their regulations. Such compliance can be costly and burdensome and may affect the way we conduct our business. Delays in receiving required regulatory approvals (including approvals relating to acquisitions or financing activities or for interconnection agreements with other carriers), the enactment of new and adverse international or domestic legislation or regulations (including those pertaining to broadband initiatives and net-neutrality), or the denial, modification or termination by a regulator of any approval or authorization, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, the current regulatory landscape is subject to change through judicial review of current legislation and rulemaking by the FCC, Ofcom, ARCEP, and other domestic, foreign, and international rulemaking bodies. These bodies regularly consider changes to their regulatory framework and fee obligations. Changes in current regulation may make it more difficult to obtain the approvals necessary to operate our business, significantly increase the regulatory fees to which we are subject, or have other adverse effects on our future operations in the United States and Europe.We may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our network.Although we believe our liability for third party information stored on or transmitted through our networks is limited, the liability of private network operators is limited both by changing technology and evolving legal principles.  As a private network provider, we could be exposed to legal claims relating to third party content stored or transmitted on our networks.  Such claims could involve, among others, allegations of defamation, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement, or aiding and abetting restricted activities such as online gambling or pornography.  If we decide to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to these risks or if we are required to defend ourselves against these kinds of claims, our operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected.   Unfavorable general global economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.Unfavorable general global economic conditions could negatively affect our business. Although it is difficult to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of, and customer demand for, our services, and could cause customers to delay or forgo purchases of our services. One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline. Also, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to purchase our services or make timely payments to us. The current economic conditions, including federal fiscal and monetary policy actions, may lead to inflationary conditions in our cost base, particularly in our lease and personnel related expenses. This could harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase prices or reduce costs sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation in our cost base. For these reasons, among others, if challenging economic conditions persist or worsen, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our existing indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all.Disruptions in the financial markets could impact our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, or lines of credit, in the future as well as impact our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all, which could affect our strategic operations and our financial performance and force modifications to our operations.23 Changes in our traffic patterns or industry practice could result in increasing peering costs for our IP network.Peering agreements with other ISPs have allowed us to access the Internet and exchange traffic with these providers. In most cases, we peer with these ISPs on a payment-free basis, referred to as settlement-free peering. We plan to continue to leverage this settlement-free peering. If other providers change the terms upon which they allow settlement-free peering or if changes in Internet traffic patterns, including the ratio of inbound to outbound traffic, cause us to fall below the criteria that these providers use in allowing settlement-free peering, the costs of operating our Internet backbone will likely increase. Any increases in costs could have an adverse effect on our margins and our ability to compete in the IP market.Terrorism and natural disasters could adversely impact our business.The ongoing threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on business, financial and general economic conditions. Effects from these events and any future terrorist activity, including cyber terrorism, may, in turn, increase our costs due to the need to provide enhanced security, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. Terrorist activity could damage or destroy our Internet infrastructure and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, raise capital, and operate and maintain our network access points. We are particularly vulnerable to acts of terrorism because of our large datacenter presence in New York. We are also susceptible to other catastrophic events such as major natural disasters, extreme weather, fires, or similar events that could affect our headquarters, other offices, our network, infrastructure, or equipment, all of which could adversely affect our business. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock  Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other risk factors described herein, these factors include:  •actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;  •announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  •changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies in our industry;  •the addition or loss of significant customers;  •fluctuations in the trading volume of our common stock or the size of our public float;  •announcements by us with regard to the effectiveness of our internal controls and our ability to accurately report our financial results;  •price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;  •general economic, legal, regulatory and market conditions unrelated to our performance;  •lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and  •other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events. The stock markets have experienced extreme fluctuations in price and trading volume that have caused and will likely continue to cause the stock prices of many telecommunications companies to fluctuate in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of declining stock prices. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, we could face substantial costs and be forced to divert resources and the attention of management from our business, which could adversely affect our business.  If securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Certain securities and industry analysts currently publish research reports with respect to our common stock and certain of our debt securities. If they fail to publish reports about us or our securities regularly, or otherwise cease to cover our Company, demand for our stock could decrease and the trading price of our stock could decline. A downgrade of our stock or the publication of inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business would likely cause our stock price to decline.  24 Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain. The price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or if there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale. We have a relatively small public float relative to the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, and a substantial majority of our issued and outstanding shares are restricted as a result of securities laws, the Stockholders Agreement, or other contractual provisions that restrict transfers. There are outstanding 243,008,679 shares of our common stock. Shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and various vesting agreements in some cases. Holders of approximately 176.8 million shares of our common stock are parties to a Stockholders Agreement among the Company and certain stockholders named therein (the “Stockholders Agreement”) that limits their ability to transfer their shares until after October 22, 2015, other than to affiliates, pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement entered into in connection with the consummation of our IPO or for bona fide hedging purposes. The Stockholders Agreement provides, however, that approximately 21.1 million of the shares held by parties to the agreement will be released from the restrictions thereunder in certain circumstances. The holders of an aggregate of approximately 176.8 million shares of our common stock outstanding have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders. Once any such registration statement is filed and effective, the shares registered therein will be able to be sold freely in the public market upon issuance, subject to existing market standoff or lock-up agreements.   In addition, there are 14 million shares reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plan, and we could also make equity compensation grants outside of our stock incentive plan.  The shares issuable under our stock incentive plan have been registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8.We may issue shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in ownership dilution to you as a stockholder, and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that our stockholders may consider favorable. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:  •our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;  •our board of directors has the right to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or due to the resignation or departure of an existing board member;  •our directors are not elected by cumulative voting, which would allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;  •advance notice of nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting is required;  •our board of directors may alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;  •our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with terms set by the board of directors, certain rights of which could be senior to those of our common stock;  •stockholders do not have the right to call a special meeting of stockholders or to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;  •approval of at least two-thirds of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, our amended and restated bylaws or the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding, among other items, the election and removal of directors; and  •directors may be removed from office only for cause. 25 We have elected not to be governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”); however, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes similar provisions providing that we may not engage in certain “business combinations” with any “interested stockholder” for three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business combination” includes, among other things, a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or did own, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the term “interested stockholder” does not include the entities that are current preferred equity holders of CII, which entities are listed in our certificate of incorporation (the “Exempt Stockholders”), each of their respective affiliates, and any of their respective direct or indirect transferees and any group as to which such persons are a party. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders (with the exception of the Exempt Stockholders described above), particularly those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and the DGCL could discourage potential takeover attempts, could reduce the price that investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and could potentially result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it otherwise would be. In addition, our debt agreements may require very significant payments if we have a change of control, which reduces the possibility that such an event will occur. Our directors, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of our common stock, together with their affiliates, continue to have substantial control over the company. Our directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, together with their affiliates, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 70.4% of our outstanding common stock as of June 30, 2015. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control our management and affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:  •delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control;  •impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or  •discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. ZGL’s ability to pay dividends to us is limited by the Credit Agreement and Indentures, which may in turn limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Our ability to pay dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred securities of ours or of our subsidiaries. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.  We incur significant costs as a result of being a publicly-traded company. Following our IPO, we are now subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations of the NYSE. Being subject to these rules and regulations results in legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and can also place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. If we do not timely satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with an established internal control framework and report on our conclusion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any delays or difficulty in satisfying the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could, among other things, cause investors to lose confidence in, or otherwise be unable to rely on, the accuracy of our reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 26 We are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. We are in the process of designing, implementing, and testing our internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation, which is a time-consuming, costly, and complicated process. We will be required to include the attestation of our independent public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting, beginning with the annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.  ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESOur principal properties are fiber optic networks and their component assets. We own a majority of the communications equipment required for operating the network and our business. As of June 30, 2015, we own or lease approximately 85,500 fiber route miles or 6,700,000 fiber miles. We provide colocation and interconnection services utilizing our own data centers located within major carrier hotels and other strategic buildings in 45 locations throughout the United States and France. We generally do not own the buildings where we provide our colocation and interconnection services; however, the zColo group managed approximately 520,000 square feet of billable colocation space. See “Item 1. Business” for additional discussion related to our network and colocation properties.We lease our corporate headquarters in Boulder, Colorado as well as regional offices and sales, administrative and other support offices. Our corporate headquarters located at 1805 29th Street, Suite 2050, Boulder, Colorado is approximately 30,000 square feet. We lease properties to locate the POPs necessary to operate our networks. Office and POP space is leased in the markets where we maintain our network and generally ranges from 100 to 5,000 square feet. Each of our business units utilize these facilities.  The majority of our leases have renewal provisions at either fair market value or a stated escalation above the last year of the current term.ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSIn the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters, and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of any such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition, or our liquidity.ITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESHolders of Our Common Stock Our common stock has traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “ZAYO” since October 17, 2014. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our common stock. Our IPO was priced at $19.00 per share on October 16, 2014. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported on the NYSE.   Year Ended June 30, 2015 High LowFirst Quarter  N/A   N/A Second Quarter 32.18  21.21 Third Quarter 31.70  25.57 Fourth Quarter 28.86  24.48  On September 11, 2015, the closing price per share of our common stock on the NYSE was 28.07 per share, and there were approximately 575 stockholders of record of our common stock. The number of holders of record is based upon the actual number of holders registered at such date and does not include holders of shares in “street name” or persons, partnerships, associates, corporations or other entities in security position listings maintained by depositories.Stock Performance GraphThe following graph illustrates the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock from our IPO in October 2014 through June 30, 2015, compared to the S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index. The comparison assumes a hypothetical investment in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices of $100 at October 17, 2014, and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.

Dividend PolicyNo dividends have been declared or paid on our shares of common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business, and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. We are a holding company, and substantially all of our operations are carried out by ZGL, and its subsidiaries. ZGL’s ability to pay dividends to us is limited by the Credit Agreement and Indentures, which may in turn limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Our ability to pay dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred securities.

Our products and services enable mission-critical, high-bandwidth applications, such as cloud-based computing, video, mobile, social media, machine-to-machine connectivity, and other bandwidth-intensive applications. Key products include leased dark fiber, fiber to cellular towers and small cell sites, dedicated wavelength connections, Ethernet, IP connectivity, cloud services and other high-bandwidth offerings. We provide our services over a unique set of dense metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks and through our interconnect-oriented datacenter facilities. Our fiber networks and datacenter facilities are critical components of the overall physical network architecture of the Internet and private networks. Our customer base includes some of the largest and most sophisticated consumers of bandwidth infrastructure services, such as wireless service providers; telecommunications service providers; financial services companies; social networking, media, and web content companies; education, research, and healthcare institutions; and governmental agencies. We typically provide our bandwidth infrastructure services for a fixed monthly recurring fee under contracts that vary between one and twenty years in length. As of June 30, 2015, we had $6.0 billion in revenue under contract with a weighted average remaining contract term of approximately 46 months. We operate our business with a unique focus on capital allocation and financial performance with the ultimate goal of maximizing equity value for our stockholders. Our core values center on partnership, alignment, and transparency with our three primary constituent groups-employees, customers, and stockholders.On October 22, 2014, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of shares of our common stock, which were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “ZAYO”. Prior to the IPO, we were a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Communications Infrastructure Investments, LLC (""CII"").  Our primary operating subsidiary is Zayo Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“ZGL”), and we are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado.Our fiscal year ends June 30 each year, and we refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 as “Fiscal 2015,” the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 as “Fiscal 2014,” and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as “Fiscal 2013.”31 Our SegmentsWe use the management approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented. The management approach is based on the manner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance. As of June 30, 2015, we have three reportable segments as described below: oPhysical Infrastructure. Through our Physical Infrastructure segment, we provide raw bandwidth infrastructure to customers that require more control of their internal networks. These services include dark fiber, mobile infrastructure (fiber-to-the-tower and small cell), and colocation and interconnection. Dark fiber is a physically separate and secure, private platform for dedicated bandwidth. We lease dark fiber pairs (usually 2 to 12 total fibers) to its customers, who “light” the fiber using their own optronics. Our mobile infrastructure services provide direct fiber connections to cell towers, small cells, hub sites, and mobile switching centers. Our datacenters offer colocation and interconnection services to our customers, who then house and power our computing and networking equipment for the purpose of aggregating and distributing data, voice, Internet, and video traffic. Physical Infrastructure customers include carriers and other communication service providers, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, major media and content companies, large enterprises, and other companies that have the expertise to run their own fiber optic networks or require interconnected technical space. The contract terms in our Physical Infrastructure segment generally tend to range from three to twenty years. oCloud and Connectivity. Our Cloud and Connectivity segment provides bandwidth infrastructure solutions over our metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks where it uses optronics to light the fiber and our customers pay for access based on the amount and type of bandwidth they purchase. Our services within this segment include wavelength, Ethernet, IP, SONET, and cloud services with capacity ranging from 1.54Mb to 100G. We target customers who require a minimum of 10G of bandwidth across their networks. Cloud and Connectivity customers include carriers, financial services companies, healthcare, government institutions, education institutions and other enterprises. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years. oOther. The Other segment is comprised primarily of Zayo Professional Services (“ZPS”). ZPS provides network and technical resources to customers in designing, acquiring and maintaining their networks. Services are typically provided for a term of one year for a fixed recurring monthly fee in the case of network and on an hourly basis for technical resources (usage revenue).  Factors Affecting Our Results of OperationsBusiness AcquisitionsWe were founded in 2007 with the investment thesis of building a bandwidth infrastructure platform to take advantage of the favorable Internet, data, and wireless growth trends driving the on-going demand for bandwidth infrastructure, and to be an active participant in the consolidation of the industry. These trends have continued in the years since our founding, despite volatile economic conditions, and we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on those trends. We have built a significant portion of our network and service offerings through 34 acquisitions to date.As a result of the growth of our business from these acquisitions, and capital expenditures and the increased debt used to fund those investing activities, our results of operations for the respective periods presented and discussed herein are not comparable.Recent Significant AcquisitionsLatisys Holdings, LLC On February 23, 2015, we acquired all of the equity interest of the subsidiaries of Latisys Holdings, LLC (“Latisys”), a colocation and infrastructure as a service (“Iaas”) provider for a price of $677.5 million, net of cash acquired.  The Latisys acquisition was funded with the proceeds of our January Notes Offering (as defined below).The Latisys acquisition added colocation and IaaS services through eight datacenters across five markets in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Denver, Orange County and London. The acquired datacenters currently total over 185,000 square feet of billable space and 33 megawatts of critical power.The results of the acquired Latisys business are included in our operating results beginning February 23, 2015.32 Neo Telecoms (“Neo”)On July 1, 2014, we acquired a 96% equity interest in Neo, a Paris-based bandwidth infrastructure company, for purchase consideration of €54.1 million ($73.9 million, net of cash acquired, based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date). The purchase consideration was funded with cash on hand available from the proceeds of the Sixth Amendment to our Credit Agreement (as defined below). The acquisition of Neo added over 300 route miles of owned Paris metro fiber and approximately 540 on-net buildings to our network. Neo also operates nine colocation centers across France, offering more than 36,000 square feet of datacenter space. The Paris and regional network throughout France were integrated into our existing European network connecting London, Frankfurt, and Amsterdam and the U.S.The results of the acquired Neo business are included in our operating results beginning July 1, 2014.Geo Networks Limited (“Geo”)On May 16, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Geo, which is a London-based dark fiber provider. The purchase consideration of £174.3 million ($292.3 million), net of cash acquired, was paid with a combination of cash on hand and available funds drawn on our Revolver (as defined below).Geo owns and operates a high capacity fiber network in the United Kingdom, providing dark fiber and colocation services to a variety of high-bandwidth sectors including media companies, service providers, financial services, datacenters, and gaming organizations. The acquisition added over 2,100 route miles to our European network and additional connectivity to 587 on-net buildings.The results of the acquired Geo business are included in our operating results beginning May 16, 2014. 33 Summary of Business AcquisitionsThe table below summarizes the dates and purchase prices (which are net of cash acquired and include assumption of debt and capital leases) of all acquisitions and asset purchases through June 30, 2015. Acquisition Date Acquisition Cost     (in millions) Memphis Networx July 31, 2007 $9.2 PPL Telecom August 24,2007 46.3 Indiana Fiber Works September 28, 2007 22.6 Onvoy November 7, 2007  70.0 Voicepipe November 7, 2007 2.8 Citynet Fiber Networks February 15, 2008 99.2 Northwest Telephone May 30, 2008 5.2 CenturyTel Tri-State Markets July 22, 2008 2.7 Columbia Fiber Solutions September 30, 2008 12.1 CityNet Holdings Assets September 30, 2008 3.4 Adesta Assets September 30, 2008 6.4 Northwest Telephone California May 26, 2009  0.0 FiberNet September 9, 2009 96.6 AGL Networks July 1, 2010 73.7 Dolphini Assets September 20, 2010 0.2 American Fiber Systems October 1, 2010 114.1 360networks December 1, 2011 317.9 MarquisNet December 31, 2011 13.6 Arialink May 1 2012 17.1 AboveNet July 2, 2012  2,210.0 FiberGate August 31, 2012 118.3 USCarrier October 1, 2012 16.1 FTS December 14, 2012 109.7 Litecast December 31, 2012 22.2 Core NAP May 31, 2013  7.1 Corelink August 1, 2013 1.9 Access October 1, 2013 40.1 FiberLink October 2, 2013 43.1 CoreXchange March 4, 2014 17.2 Geo May 16, 2014 292.3 Neo July 1, 2014 73.9 Colo Facilities Atlanta July 1, 2014 51.9 IdeaTek Systems January 1, 2015 52.7 Latisys February 23, 2015 677.5 Less portion allocated to the discontinued operations of Onvoy, LLC    (62.3)Total   $4,584.8  We completed each of the acquisitions described above, with the exception of Voicepipe and Corelink, with cash raised through combinations of equity issuances and the incurrence of debt. We acquired Voicepipe from certain existing CII equity holders in exchange for CII preferred units, and we acquired Corelink with a combination of cash and CII preferred units.  Spin-Off of BusinessIn connection with certain business combinations, we have acquired assets and liabilities that support products outside of our primary focus of providing bandwidth infrastructure services. On June 13, 2014, we spun off all of our equity interest in Onvoy, LLC (“OVS”), a business that provides voice and managed services, by a non-cash distribution to CII. The results of operations of OVS are presented as discontinued operations. See Note 4—Spin-off of Business to our consolidated financial statements.34 During Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, the results of the operations of OVS are presented in a single caption entitled, “Earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” on our consolidated statements of operations. All discussions contained in this “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” relate only to our results of operations from continuing operations.Substantial Indebtedness On July 2, 2012, ZGL and its direct wholly-owned subsidiary Zayo Capital,  Inc. (“Zayo Capital”) issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior secured first-priority notes due 2020 (the “2020 Secured Notes”) and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “2020 Unsecured Notes”, and together with the 2020 Secured Notes, the “2020 Notes”). On July 2, 2012, ZGL also entered into a $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and a $1,620.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”), which are governed by a Credit Agreement(the “Credit Agreement”) that has been subsequently amended. A portion of the net proceeds from the 2020 Notes and the Term Loan Facility, together with cash on hand and equity contributions, were used to extinguish our prior term loan facility and revolver, to finance the cash tender offer for and subsequent redemption of our prior senior secured notes, to pay the cash consideration for the AboveNet acquisition, and to pay associated fees and expenses.  In connection with the debt extinguishment activities discussed above, we recognized an expense in July 2012 of $65.0 million associated with debt extinguishment costs, including a cash expense of $39.8 million associated with the payment of early redemption fees on our previous indebtedness and non-cash expenses of $17.0 million associated with the write-off of our unamortized debt issuance costs and $8.2 million associated with writing-off the net unamortized discount on the debt balances extinguished. On October 5, 2012, ZGL and Zayo Capital entered into a second amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement governing the Term Loan Facility and Revolver. Under the terms of the Second Amendment, effective October 5, 2012, the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was adjusted to bear an interest rate at LIBOR plus 4.0% (subject to a 5.25% floor), which represented a decrease of 187.5 basis points from the original Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment also reduced the interest rate on the Revolver by 187.5 basis points. On February 27, 2013, ZGL and Zayo Capital entered into a Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Fourth Amendment, effective February 27, 2013, the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was further adjusted to bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.5% (subject to a 4.5% floor). The amended terms represent a downward adjustment of 50 basis points on the spread and a further 25 basis point reduction minimum floor. Under the terms of the Fourth Amendment, the Revolver bore interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%, based on ZGL’s current leverage ratio, which represented a 50 basis point reduction. The Fourth Amendment also amended certain terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement, including removing the senior secured and total leverage maintenance covenants and increasing the total leverage ratio required to be met in order to incur certain additional indebtedness from 5.00:1.00 to 5.25:1.00 as a multiple of EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement).In connection with the aforementioned amendments, we incurred early redemption call premiums of $16.2 million and $16.1 million for the Second Amendment and Fourth Amendment, respectively. The early redemption call premiums were paid with cash on hand to the syndicate of creditors in the Term Loan Facility. Prior to the consummation of the amendments, we requested the consent of all creditors holding balances in the Term Loan Facility to the amended terms. $15.3 million and $15.0 million of the early call premium paid to consenting creditors in the Second and Fourth Amendments, respectively, were accounted for as additional debt issuance costs for the modified obligations during the year ended June 30, 2013, which are being amortized over the term of the Term Loan Facility using the effective interest method. The remaining call premium of $0.9 million and $1.1 million associated with the Second and Fourth Amendments, respectively, that was paid to non-consenting creditors has been recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended June 30, 2013. Existing and/or new creditors replaced the non-consented commitments, such that the full amount of the Term Loan Facility’s commitments were replaced in both the Second and Fourth Amendments. In connection with the Second and Fourth Amendments, we recognized an expense of $12.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2013 associated with debt extinguishment costs. The loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the amendments includes the aforementioned early call premiums paid to non-consenting creditors, non-cash expense associated with the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and issuance discounts on the debt balances accounted for as an extinguishment, and certain fees paid to third parties involved in the amendments.   35 On November 26, 2013, ZGL and Zayo Capital entered into a Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Fifth Amendment, the Term Loan Facility was increased by $150.0 million to $1,749.8 million and the interest rate was adjusted to LIBOR plus 3.0% with a minimum LIBOR rate of 1.0%. The amended terms represented a downward adjustment of 50 basis points on the interest rate from the Fourth Amendment. The interest rate on the Revolver was amended to LIBOR plus 2.75% (based on ZGL’s then current leverage ratio), which represented a downward adjustment of 25 basis points on the interest rate from the Fourth Amendment. In connection with the Fifth Amendment, we did not incur a re-pricing premium.     Also, in connection with the Fifth Amendment, we recognized an expense during the second quarter of Fiscal 2014 of $1.9 million associated with debt extinguishment costs, including cash expense of $1.0 million related to third party costs and non-cash expense of $0.9 million associated with the write-off of our unamortized debt issuance costs and discount on the Term Loan Facility accounted for as an extinguishment. We also incurred an additional $1.5 million in debt issuance costs in the second quarter of Fiscal 2014.On May 16, 2014, ZGL and Zayo Capital entered into a Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Per the terms of the Sixth Amendment, our Term Loan Facility was increased by $275.0 million to $2,015.9 million and bears interest at the existing rate of LIBOR plus 3.0 percent with a minimum LIBOR rate of 1.0 percent. The $275.0 million add-on was priced at 99.5 percent. No other terms of the Credit Agreement were amended. In connection with the Sixth Amendment, we incurred an additional $3.2 million in debt issuance costs and $1.4 million was recorded as a discount.  On December 15, 2014, ZGL redeemed $75.0 million of its outstanding 2020 Secured Notes at a price of 108.125% of the principal amount and $174.4 million of its outstanding 2020 Unsecured Notes at a price of 110.125% (collectively, the “December Notes Redemption”). As part of the December Notes Redemption, we recorded an early redemption call premium of $23.8 million which has been recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of operations in Fiscal 2015.       On January 23, 2015, ZGL and Zayo Capital (together, the “Issuers”) completed a private offering (the “January Notes Offering”) of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2023 (the “2023 Unsecured Notes”).  On March 9, 2015, the Issuers completed a private offering of an additional $730.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Unsecured Notes at a premium of 1% (the “March Notes Offering”, and together with the January Notes Offering, the “2023 Notes Offerings”) resulting in aggregate gross proceeds for the 2023 Unsecured Notes of $1,437.3 million.  The issue premium of $7.3 million on the March Notes Offering is being accreted against interest expense over the term of the 2023 Notes under the effective interest method.  The 2023 Unsecured Notes bear interest at the rate of 6.00% per year, which is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2015. The 2023 Unsecured Notes will mature on April 1, 2023.  The net proceeds from the January Notes Offering were used to fund the Latisys acquisition (see Note 3 – Acquisitions).   The net proceeds from the March Notes Offering were used to redeem our remaining $675.0 million 2020 Secured Notes (the “Second Notes Redemption”) at a price of 105.75%.  As part of the Second Notes Redemption, we recorded an early redemption call premium of $38.8 million.  The call premium has been recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended June 30, 2015.  On April 17, 2015, ZGL entered into a Seventh Amendment (the “Seventh Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Per the terms of the Seventh Amendment, the Revolver was increased by $200.0 million to $450.0 million, and the maturity date of the Revolver was extended to the earliest of (i) five years after the effective date of the Seventh Amendment, (ii) six months prior to the maturity date of our Term Loan Facility, subject to repayment or amendment thereof, and (iii) six months prior to the maturity date of the 2020 Unsecured Notes, subject to repayment or amendment thereof.  The Seventh Amendment also increased the letter of credit commitment from $30.0 to $50.0 and provided that, in the event that the Term Loan Facility was amended or refinanced to remove all financial maintenance covenants, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio maintenance requirement would be replaced with a springing Senior Secured Leverage Ratio maintenance requirement applicable only to the Revolver. Further, pursuant to the Seventh Amendment, up to $50.0 of revolving loans and letters of credit may be denominated in or issued in, as applicable, Euros or British Pound Sterling. On May 6, 2015, ZGL and Zayo Capital issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due in 2025 (the “2025 Unsecured Notes”). Interest on the 2025 Unsecured Notes is payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2015. The 2025 Unsecured Notes will mature on May 15, 2025.  The net proceeds from the 2025 Unsecured Notes were used to repay $344.5 million of our Term Loan Facility. As a result of that repayment, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million.  36 On May 6, 2015, ZGL entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement whereby the Credit Agreement was amended and restated in its entirety. The amended and restated Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of all of the outstanding term loans under the Term Loan Facility to May 6, 2021. The interest rate margins applicable to the Term Loan Facility were decreased by 25 basis points to LIBOR plus 2.75% with a minimum LIBOR of 1.0%. In addition, the amended and restated Credit Agreement removed the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant and replaced such covenant with a springing Senior Secured Leverage Ratio maintenance requirement applicable only to the Revolver, increased certain lien and debt baskets, and removed certain covenants related to collateral.Interest rates on the Term Loan Facility and Revolver as of June 30, 2015 were 3.75% and 3.0%, respectively.As of June 30, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolver. Substantial Capital ExpendituresDuring Fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, we invested, net of stimulus grant reimbursements, $530.4 million, $360.8 million, and $332.6 million, respectively, in capital expenditures primarily to expand our fiber network to support new customer contracts. We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures in future periods.  Background for Review of Our Results of OperationsRevenueOur revenue is comprised predominately of monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”). MRR is related to an ongoing service that is generally fixed in price and paid by the customer on a monthly basis. We also report monthly amortized revenue (“MAR”), which represents the amortization of previously collected upfront charges to customers. Upfront charges are typically related to IRUs structured as pre-payments rather than monthly recurring payments (though we structure IRUs as both prepaid and recurring, largely dependent on the customers’ preference) and installation fees. The last category of revenue we report is other revenue. Other revenue includes credits and adjustments, termination revenue, construction services, and equipment sales.Our consolidated reported revenue in any given period is a function of our beginning revenue under contract and the impact of organic growth and acquisition activity. Our organic activity is driven by net new sales (“bookings”), gross installed revenue (“installs”) and churn processed (“churn”) as further described below.Net New Sales.   Net new sales (“bookings”) represent the dollar amount of orders, to be recorded as MRR and MAR upon installation, in a period that have been signed by the customer and accepted by our service delivery organization. The dollar value of bookings is equal to the monthly recurring price that the customer will pay for the services and/or the monthly amortized amount of the revenue that we will recognize for those services. To the extent a booking is cancelled by the customer prior to it being installed, it is subtracted from the total bookings number in the period that it is cancelled. Bookings do not immediately impact revenue until they are installed (gross installed revenue).Gross Installed Revenue.   Installs are the amount of MRR and MAR for services that have been installed, tested, accepted by the customer, and have been recognized in revenue during a given period.   Installs include new services, price increases, and upgrades.Churn Processed.   Churn is any negative change to MRR and MAR. Churn includes disconnects, negative price changes, and disconnects associated with upgrades or replacement services. For each period presented, disconnects associated with attrition and upgrades are the drivers of churn, accounting for more than 80% of negative changes in MRR and MAR while price changes account for less than 20%. Monthly churn is also presented as a percentage of MRR and MAR (“churn percentage”).Given the size and amount of acquisitions we have completed, we have estimated the revenue growth rate associated with our organic activity in each period reported. Our estimated organic growth rate is calculated by adding an estimate of the acquired companies’ revenue for the reporting period prior to the date of inclusion in our results of operations, and then calculating the growth rate between the two reported periods. The estimate of acquired annual revenue is based on the acquired companies’ revenues for the most recent quarter prior to close (including estimated purchase accounting adjustments) multiplied by four. If, in calculating our estimated organic growth rates, we were to use the actual revenue results for the four quarters preceding the closing of each of our acquisitions, our estimated organic growth rates would be higher than the estimated organic growth rates presented. If we were to use acquired annualized revenue, calculated by taking each acquired company’s revenues for the most recent quarter prior to the closing of such acquisition and multiplying by four, our estimated organic growth rates would be lower than the estimated organic growth rates presented.37 We have foreign subsidiaries that enter into contracts with customers and vendors in currencies other than the United States Dollar (“USD”) – principally the Great British Pound (“GBP”) and to a lesser extent the Euro. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our revenue and expenses each period. The comparisons excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates assume exchange rates remained constant at the comparative period rate.Operating Costs and ExpensesOur operating costs and expenses consist of network expense (“Netex”), compensation and benefits, network operations expense (“Netops”), stock-based compensation expense, other expenses, and depreciation and amortization.Netex consists of third-party network service costs resulting from our leasing of certain network facilities, primarily leases of circuits and dark fiber, from carriers to augment our owned infrastructure, for which we are generally billed a fixed monthly fee. Netex also includes colocation facility costs for rent and license fees paid to the landlords of the buildings in which our colocation business operates, along with the utility costs to power those facilities. While increases in demand for our services will drive additional operating costs in our business, consistent with our strategy of leveraging our owned infrastructure assets, we expect to primarily utilize our existing network infrastructure or build new network infrastructure to meet the demand. In limited circumstances, we will augment our network with additional circuits or services from third-party providers. Third-party network service costs include the upfront cost of the initial installation of such circuits. Such costs are included in operating costs in our consolidated statements of operations over the respective service period.Compensation and benefits expenses include salaries, wages, incentive compensation and benefits. Employee-related costs that are directly associated with network construction, service installations (and development of business support systems) are capitalized and amortized to operating costs and expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses related to the departments attributed to generating revenue are included in our operating costs line item while compensation and benefits expenses related to the sales, product, and corporate departments are included in our selling, general and administrative expenses line item of our consolidated statements of operations.Netops expense includes all of the non-personnel related expenses of operating and maintaining our network infrastructure, including contracted maintenance fees, right-of-way costs, rent for cellular towers and other places where fiber is located, pole attachment fees, and relocation expenses. Such costs are included in operating costs in our consolidated statements of operations.Prior to our IPO, our stock-based compensation expense contained two components, CII common unit awards classified as liabilities and, to a lesser extent, CII preferred unit awards classified as equity. For the CII common units granted to employees and directors, we recognized an expense equal to the fair value of all of those common units that vest during the period plus the change in fair value of previously vested units, and recorded a liability in respect of those amounts. Following the IPO, our stock-based compensation expense contains three components: previously granted CII common unit awards, CII preferred unit awards and restricted stock unit awards made under our new equity compensation program. For previously granted CII common unit awards, following the IPO, we amortize the offering date fair value of those units (including unvested units) over the vesting period based on expected settlement behavior with a corresponding adjustment to equity, as the awards no longer have cash settlement features. For previously granted CII preferred units, we use the straight line method, over the vesting period, to amortize the fair value of those units, as determined on the date of grant. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock unit awards granted to employees, members of management, and directors based on their estimated grant date fair value on a straight line basis over the requisite service period, as adjusted for an estimate of forfeitures. These restricted stock unit awards are primarily equity classified, except certain awards that have not yet been granted to employees. Following our IPO, subsequent changes in the fair value of the CII preferred and common units and restricted stock unit awards granted generally do not affect the amount of expense we recognize.Stock-based compensation expense is included, based on the responsibilities of the awarded recipient, in either our operating costs or selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.Other expenses include expenses such as property tax, franchise fees, colocation facility maintenance, travel, office expense and other administrative costs. Other expenses are included in both operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses depending on their relationship to generating revenue or association with sales and administration. Transaction costs include expenses associated with professional services (i.e. legal, accounting, regulatory, etc.) rendered in connection with acquisitions or disposals (including spin-offs), travel expense, severance expense incurred on the date of acquisition or disposal, and other direct expenses incurred that are associated with signed and/or closed acquisitions or disposals. Transaction costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.  38 Results of OperationsRefer to “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” for additional financial information for the indicated periods.Year Ended June 30, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2014Revenue   Year ended June 30   2015  2014  $ Variance  % Variance   (in millions) Segment and consolidated revenue:                Physical Infrastructure $662.4  $495.4  $167.0   34%Cloud and Connectivity  661.5   606.2   55.3   9%Other  23.2   28.1   (4.9)  (17%)Eliminations  —   (6.5)  6.5   (100%)Consolidated $1,347.1  $1,123.2  $223.9   20% Our total revenue increased by $223.9 million, or 20%, to $1,347.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, from $1,123.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase in revenue was driven by our organic growth as well as Fiscal 2014 and 2015 acquisitions.We estimate that the period-over-period organic growth was approximately 7%. Our organic growth was driven by installs that exceeded churn over the course of both periods, resulting from continued strong demand for bandwidth infrastructure services broadly across our service territory and customer verticals. Additional underlying revenue drivers included: •Bookings decreased period-over-period from $21.8 million to $24.8 million in combined MRR and MAR. The total contract value associated with bookings for the year ended June 30, 2015 was approximately $1,849.9 million. •During the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company recognized net installs of $7.2 million as compared to $5.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2014. •Monthly churn percentage between the two periods decreased to 1.3% from 1.4%.We estimate that the period-over-period acquisition-related revenue growth was approximately 13%.The average exchange rate between the USD and GBP strengthened by 8.4% during the year ended June 30, 2015.  Normalizing our revenue to exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we estimate that revenue would have increased between the year ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 by an additional $2.2 million.  Physical Infrastructure.   Revenue from our Physical Infrastructure segment increased by $167.0 million, or 34%, to $662.4 million from $495.4 million, for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was a result of both organic and acquisition related growth.Dark Fiber is the largest Strategic Product Group within the segment and benefited from continued growth in infrastructure demand. Our FTT and zColo products also contributed to the segment’s growth. Bookings of MRR and MAR for the year ended June 30, 2015 were $11.5 million (with a total contract value of approximately $1,425.6 million), an increase from the $0.9 million in bookings for the same period in the prior year. Gross installs were $9.7 million for Fiscal 2015, compared to $8.1 million for Fiscal 2014. The monthly churn percentage was consistent between the two periods at 0.8%, resulting in total churn processed of $5.0 million compared to $3.9 million in the same period in the prior year.Cloud and Connectivity.   Revenue from our Cloud and Connectivity segment increased by $55.3 million, or 9%, to $661.5 million from $606.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was a result of both organic and acquisition related growth.Growth was strongest in the segment’s Ethernet and IP Strategic Product Groups, driven by customer demand and increased effectiveness in marketing these products. Wavelength revenue growth was dampened by churn, including price concessions that were proactively offered in exchange for customer contract extensions. SONET is a legacy product, and its revenue declined between the two periods, consistent with our expectations.39 Bookings of MRR and MAR increased from $11.1 million to $12.7 million between the two comparative periods, with a total contract value of approximately $405.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Gross installs were $12.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, compared to $11.5 million in the prior year. The monthly churn percentage decreased from 1.7% to 1.6%, resulting in total churn processed of $9.9 million compared to $10.2 million in the same period in the prior year.Other.   Revenue from our Other segment decreased by $4.9 million, or 17%, to $23.2 million from $28.1 million, for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease was the result of the non-recurring nature of revenue related to the Other segment, which had slightly lower sales in Fiscal 2015 as compared to Fiscal 2014.  The Other segment represented approximately 1.7% of our total revenue during the year ended June 30, 2015.The following table reflects the stratification of our revenues during these periods. The substantial majority of our revenue continued to come from recurring payments from customers under contractual arrangements.   Year ended June 30,   2015  2014   (in millions) Monthly recurring revenue $1,211.8   90% $1,030.1   92%Amortization of deferred revenue  72.1   5%  55.6   5%Other Revenue  63.2   5%  37.5   3%Total Revenue $1,347.1   100% $1,123.2   100% Operating Costs and Expenses   Year ended June 30   2015  2014  $ Variance  % Variance   (in millions) Segment and consolidated operating costs and expenses:                Physical Infrastructure $606.0  $541.9  $64.1   12%Cloud and Connectivity  550.5   502.9   47.6   9%Other  21.6   22.3   (0.7)  (3%)Consolidated $1,178.1  $1,067.1  $111.0   10% Our operating costs increased by $111.0 million, or 10% to $1,178.1 million for Fiscal 2015 from $1,067.1 million for Fiscal 2014. The increase in consolidated operating costs was primarily due to increased costs as a result of Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 acquisition related growth, and organic growth of our network, partially offset by a $53.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation.Physical Infrastructure.    Physical Infrastructure operating costs increased by $64.1 million, or 12%, to $606.0 million for Fiscal 2015 from $541.9 million for Fiscal 2014. The increase in operating costs and expenses was primarily a result of the timing of our Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 acquisitions and additional costs associated with the organic growth of our network partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. Cloud and Connectivity.    Cloud and Connectivity operating costs increased by $47.6 million, or 9%, to $550.5 million for Fiscal 2015 from $502.9 million for Fiscal 2014. The increase in operating costs and expenses was primarily a result of the timing of our Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 acquisitions. Other.   Other operating costs decreased by $0.7 million, or 3%, to $21.6 million for Fiscal 2015 from $22.3 million for Fiscal 2014 as a result of decreased revenue from ZPS. 40 The table below sets forth the components of our operating costs and expenses during the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:   Year ended June 30,   2015  2014  $ Variance  % Variance   (in millions) Netex $178.3  $150.4  $27.9   19%Compensation and benefits expenses 158.6  126.3   32.3   26%Netops expense  152.5   131.4   21.1   16%Other expenses  75.6   61.8   13.8   22%Transaction costs  6.2   5.3   0.9   17%Stock-based compensation  200.7   253.7   (53.0)  (21%)Depreciation and Amortization  406.2   338.2   68.0   20%Total operating costs and expenses $1,178.1  $1,067.1  $111.0   10% Netex.    Our Netex increased by 27.9 million, or 19%, to $178.3 million for Fiscal 2015 from $150.4 million for Fiscal 2014. The increase in Netex was primarily due to increased facility costs related to the colocation acquisitions completed in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, partially offset by cost savings, as planned network related synergies were realized. Netex as a percentage of total revenue remained at 13% for Fiscal 2015 and 2014. Compensation and Benefits Expenses.    Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $32.3 million, or 26%, to $158.6 million for Fiscal 2015 from $126.3 million for Fiscal 2014.The increase in compensation and benefits reflected the increase in headcount during Fiscal 2015 to support our growing business, including certain employees retained from businesses acquired since June 30, 2014, and employer matching of employee 401(k) contributions beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014. Headcount as of the end of the respective periods was:   June 30,  June 30,   2015  2014 Physical Infrastructure  993   861 Cloud and Connectivity  725   623 Other  115   29 Total  1,833   1,513  Network Operations Expenses.    Network operations expenses increased by $21.1 million, or 16%, to $152.5 million for Fiscal 2015 from $131.4 million for Fiscal 2014. The increase principally reflected the growth of our network assets and the related expenses of operating that expanded network. Our total network route miles increased approximately 6% to 85,644 miles at June 30, 2015 from 80,861 miles at June 30, 2014.Other Expenses.    Other expenses increased by $13.8 million, or 22%, to $75.6 million for Fiscal 2015, from $61.8 million Fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily the result of additional expenses attributable to our Fiscal 2014 and 2015 acquisitions.Transaction Costs.    Transaction costs increased by $0.9 million, or 17%, to $6.2 million for Fiscal 2015 from $5.3 million for Fiscal 2014. The increase was due to higher transaction-related costs associated with our Fiscal 2015 acquisitions. Stock-Based Compensation.    Stock-based compensation expense decreased by $53.0 million, or 21%, to $200.7 million for Fiscal 2015 from $253.7 million for Fiscal 2014. Prior to our IPO, we recognized changes in the fair value of the common units through increases or decreases in stock-based compensation expense and adjustments to the related stock-based compensation liability. This liability was impacted by changes in the estimated value of the common units, number of vested common units, and distributions made to holders of the common units. In connection with the IPO, we re-measured the fair value of the common units at the offering date based on various projections involving future stock performance, vesting and forfeitures. The fair value of unvested common units on the offering date is recognized as stock-based compensation expense ratably over the remaining vesting period. For restricted stock unit awards, expense is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the units awarded over the requisite service period.  The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards is impacted by various factors, including market and performance-based targets, expectations regarding future stock performance, the measurement or performance period, and forfeiture rates.  The higher Fiscal 2014 stock-based compensation expense is primarily driven by increases to the estimated fair value of our liability classified common unit awards. 41  Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $68.0 million, or 20%, to $406.2 million for Fiscal 2015 from $338.2 million for Fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily the result of depreciation related to capital expenditures since June 30, 2014 and acquisition-related growth.Total Other Expense, NetThe table below sets forth the components of our total other expense, net for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.   Year ended June 30,   2015  2014  $ Variance  % Variance   (in millions) Interest expense $(214.0) $(203.5) $(10.5)  (5%)Loss on extinguishment of debt  (94.3)  (1.9)  (92.4) * Foreign currency (loss)/gain on intercompany loans  (24.4)  4.7   (29.1) * Other (expense)/income, net  (0.4)  0.3   (0.7)  (233%)Total other expenses, net $(333.1) $(200.4) $(132.7)  (66%) *Not meaningful Interest expense.   Interest expense increased by $10.5 million, or 5%, to $214.0 million from $203.5 million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily a result of our increased indebtedness and changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps, partially offset by reduced interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness as a result of our Fiscal 2015 debt transactions.Loss on extinguishment of debt.   During the year ended June 30, 2015, we redeemed our $750.0 million 2020 Secured Notes and a portion of our 2020 Unsecured Notes and repaid $344.5 million on our Term Loan Facility.  As part of the redemptions and early payment on the Term Loan Facility, we paid early redemption call premiums totaling $62.6 million and recorded an expense of $31.7 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts associated with the extinguished indebtedness.  These expenses were recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended June 30, 2015.Foreign currency (loss)/gain on intercompany loans.   Foreign currency (loss)/gain on intercompany loans decreased to a loss of $24.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2015, from a gain of $4.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2014.  This non-cash loss was driven by the strengthening of the USD against the GBP and the related impact on intercompany loans entered into by foreign subsidiaries in their functional currency.(Benefit)/provision for Income TaxesIncome tax expense decreased over the prior year by $46.1 million, to an income tax benefit of $8.8 million for Fiscal 2015, from an income tax expense of $37.3 million for Fiscal 2014. Our provision for income taxes included both the current provision and a provision for deferred income tax expense resulting from timing differences between tax and financial reporting accounting bases. In addition, as a result of our stock-based compensation related to our CII common and preferred units and certain transaction costs not being deductible for income tax purposes, our effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate.42 The following table reconciles an expected tax provision based on a statutory federal tax rate applied to our earnings before income tax to our actual provision for income taxes (in millions):   Year ended June 30,   2015  2014 Expected benefit/provision at the statutory rate $(57.4) $(50.5)Increase/(decrease) due to:        Non-deductible stock-based compensation  59.4   96.5 State income taxes benefit, net of federal benefit  (7.4)  (6.6)Transactions costs not deductible for tax purposes  0.7   0.8 Reversal of uncertain tax positions, net —   (2.6)Change in effective tax rate  (2.2)  (0.3)Change in valuation allowance —   1.3 Foreign tax rate differential  0.6   1.0 Other, net  (2.5)  (2.3)(Benefit)/provision for income taxes $(8.8) $37.3  Discontinued OperationsOur earnings from discontinued operation, net of taxes, of $2.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2014 relates to the operations of OVS, which we spun off on June 13, 2014.  See Note 4-Spin-off of Business to our consolidated financial statements.  Year Ended June 30, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2013Revenue   Year ended June 30   2014  2013  $ Variance  % Variance   (in millions) Segment and consolidated revenue:                Physical Infrastructure $495.4  $413.0  $82.4   20%Cloud and Connectivity  606.2   570.5   35.7   6%Other  28.1   27.8   0.3   1%Eliminations  (6.5)  (6.9)  0.4   (6%)Consolidated $1,123.2  $1,004.4  $118.8   12% Our total revenue increased by $118.8 million, or 12%, to $1,123.2 million for Fiscal 2014, from $1,004.4 million for Fiscal 2013. The increase in revenue was driven by our organic growth as well as the timing of our Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 acquisitions.We estimate that we achieved an organic growth rate of approximately 6% year-over-year. Our organic growth was driven by installs that exceeded churn over the course of both periods, resulting from continued strong demand for bandwidth infrastructure services broadly across our service territory and customer industry verticals. Further underlying revenue drivers included: •Bookings increased from $17.7 million to $21.8 million in combined MRR and MAR. This growth was driven by increased customer demand for our services, our growing fiber and datacenter footprint (from both organic investments and acquisitions), and our sales force’s improved effectiveness in selling this base of assets. The total contract value associated with this period’s bookings was approximately $1,700.0 million. •Installs increased to $5.2 million for Fiscal 2014, from $4.8 million for Fiscal 2013, but trailed the increase in bookings, which included more infrastructure-related services with longer booking to install time intervals. Examples included several FTT sales and a large dark fiber sale to Level 3 (previously, TW Telecom). •Total churn grew to $14.7 million from $13.6 million, although the monthly churn percentage remained constant at 1.4% between Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2014.43 We estimate that the period-over-period acquisition-related revenue growth was approximately 6%. Multiple Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 acquisitions impacted revenue growth between the two periods. The five Fiscal 2014 acquisitions were completed on August 1, 2013, October 1, 2013, October 2, 2013, March 4, 2014, and May 16, 2014 and were included in our Fiscal 2014 results for approximately eleven, nine, nine, four, and one month(s), respectively. The Fiscal 2014 acquisitions represented smaller acquisitions of dark fiber and colocation-only providers, with the exception of Geo, which was a larger acquisition of a European-based dark fiber and wavelength services provider completed in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014. The six Fiscal 2013 acquisitions were completed at various times throughout the year, although the largest (AboveNet) closed on July 2, 2012 and was fully included in our annual results for the year ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 and therefore was not a contributor to the period-over-period acquisition growth. The other acquisitions were included in our results of operations for only part of Fiscal 2013 compared to their inclusion for all of Fiscal 2014.Physical Infrastructure.    Revenues from our Physical Infrastructure segment increased by $82.4 million, or 20%, to $495.4 million for Fiscal 2014 from $413.0 million for Fiscal 2013.Dark fiber is the largest Strategic Product Group within the segment and benefited from continuing growth in infrastructure demand. Our FTT and zColo products also contributed to the segment’s growth. Bookings of MRR and MAR for the year ended June 30, 2014, were $10.6 million (with a total contract value of approximately $1,300.0 million), nearly double the $6.3 million in bookings for the prior annual period. Installs were $8.1 million for Fiscal 2014, compared to $6.5 million for the prior annual period. The monthly churn percentage decreased between the two periods to 0.8% from 0.9%. All of the Fiscal 2014 acquisitions impacted the Physical Infrastructure segment revenues as FiberLink (dark fiber) and CoreLink and CoreXchange (both colocation) were Physical Infrastructure-only businesses and Geo was primarily Physical Infrastructure (dark fiber).Cloud and Connectivity.    Revenues from our Cloud and Connectivity segment increased by $35.7 million, or 6%, to $606.2 million for Fiscal 2014, from $570.5 million for Fiscal 2013.Growth was strongest in the segment’s Ethernet and IP Strategic Product Groups, driven by customer demand and increased effectiveness in marketing these products. Wavelength revenue growth was dampened by churn, including price concessions we proactively offered in exchange for customer contract extensions. SONET is a legacy product, and its revenue declined between the two periods, consistent with our expectations. Bookings of MRR and MAR decreased slightly to $11.1 million from $11.3 million between the two periods, with a total contract value of approximately $420.0 million, for the year ended June 30, 2014. Installs were $11.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2014, compared to $11.8 million for the comparative annual period. The monthly churn percentage remained consistent at 1.7% for the two periods, resulting in total churn processed of $10.2 million compared to $9.6 million in the prior fiscal year. The Cloud and Connectivity period-over-period revenue results were primarily influenced by the carryover impacts from the Fiscal 2013 acquisitions, as the Fiscal 2014 acquisitions mostly impacted the Physical Infrastructure segment.Other.    Revenue from our Other segment, consisting of ZPS, increased by 1%, or $0.3 million, to $28.1 million for Fiscal 2014 from $27.8 million for Fiscal 2013. The increase was largely driven by a one-time equipment sale in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014. The Other segment represented approximately 3% of our total revenue.The following table reflects the stratification of our revenues during these periods. The substantial majority of our revenue continued to come from recurring payments from customers under contractual arrangements.   Year ended June 30,   2014  2013 Monthly recurring revenue $1,030.1   92% $941.2   94%Amortization of deferred revenue  55.6   5%  43.1   4%Other Revenue  37.5   3%  20.1   2%Total Revenue $1,123.2   100% $1,004.4   100% 44 Operating Costs and Expenses   Year ended June 30   2014  2013  $ Variance  % Variance   (in millions) Segment and consolidated operating costs and expenses:                Physical Infrastructure $541.9  $374.6  $167.3   45%Cloud and Connectivity  502.9   497.5   5.4   1%Other  22.3   24.2   (1.9)  (8%)Eliminations  —   (1.5)  1.5   (100%)Consolidated $1,067.1  $894.8  $172.3   19% Physical Infrastructure.    Physical Infrastructure operating costs and expenses increased by $167.3 million, or 45%, to $541.9 million for Fiscal 2014 from $374.6 million for Fiscal 2013. The increase in operating costs and expenses was primarily a result of the acquisitions of Geo, CoreXchange, Fiberlink, Access, Corelink and CoreNAP, in Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.Cloud and Connectivity.    Cloud and Connectivity operating costs and expenses increased by $5.4 million, or 1%, to $502.9 million for Fiscal 2014 from $497.5 million for Fiscal 2013. The relatively flat operating costs and expenses in relation to the 6% increase in revenue for Cloud and Connectivity was primarily due to realized network-related cost synergies related to our acquisitions, and, to a lesser extent, ongoing off-net circuit cost reduction projects.Other.    Other operating costs and expenses decreased by $1.9 million, or 8%, to $22.3 million for Fiscal 2014 from $24.2 million for Fiscal 2013. The reduction in other operating costs and expenses was primarily attributable to a reduction in MRR.The table below sets forth the components of our operating costs and expenses during the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.   Year ended June 30   2014  2013  $ Variance  % Variance   (in millions) Netex $150.4  $145.9  $4.5   3%Compensation and benefits expenses  126.3   123.4   2.9   2%Netops expense  131.4   120.9   10.5   9%Other Operating expense  61.8   60.1   1.7   3%Transaction costs  5.3   14.2   (8.9)  (63%)Stock-based compensation  253.7   105.8   147.9   140%Depreciation and Amortization  338.2   324.5   13.7   4%Total Operating costs and expenses $1,067.1  $894.8  $172.3   19% Netex.    Our Netex increased by $4.5 million, or 3%, to $150.4 million for Fiscal 2014 from $145.9 million for Fiscal 2013. The increase in Netex was primarily due to increased facility costs related to the colocation acquisitions completed in Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2014, partially offset by cost savings, as planned network related synergies were realized. Netex as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 13% from 15% as a result of cost reductions and because our incremental revenue typically has less third-party network service costs associated with it than the existing base of revenue.Compensation and Benefits Expenses.    Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 2%, from $123.4 million for Fiscal 2013 to $126.3 million for Fiscal 2014.The increase in compensation and benefits reflected the increase in headcount during Fiscal 2014 to support our growing business, including certain employees retained from businesses acquired since June 30, 2013, and employer matching of employee 401(k) contributions beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014. This was partially offset by a reduction in bonus payout as the average payout for the year ended June 30, 2013 was approximately 130% of target as compared to approximately 100% of target for the year ended June 30, 2014.45 Headcount as of the end of the respective periods was:   Year ended June 30,   2014  2013 Physical Infrastructure 861  584 Cloud and Connectivity 623  546 Other 29  30 Total  1,513   1,160  Netops.    Netops expense increased by $10.5 million, or 9%, to $131.4 million for Fiscal 2014 from $120.9 million for Fiscal 2013. The increase principally reflected the growth of our network assets and the related expenses of operating that expanded network. Our total network route miles increased approximately 7%, to 80,860 miles at June 30, 2014, from 75,839 miles at June 30, 2013.Other Expenses.    Other expenses increased by $1.7 million, or 3%, to $61.8 million for Fiscal 2014 from $60.1 million for Fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily the result of additional expenses attributable to our Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 acquisitions, which were partially offset by the receipt of $3.8 million in connection with an escrow settlement relating to the 360networks acquisition during the second quarter of Fiscal 2014.Transaction Costs.    Transaction costs decreased by $8.9 million, or 63%, to $5.3 million for Fiscal 2014 from $14.2 million for Fiscal 2013. The decrease was due to higher transaction-related costs in the first quarter of Fiscal 2013 associated with the AboveNet acquisition, partially offset by the transaction-related costs associated with the Geo and Neo acquisitions in Fiscal 2014.Stock-Based Compensation.    Stock-based compensation expense increased by $147.9 million, or 140%, from $105.8 million for Fiscal 2013 to $253.7 million for Fiscal 2014. Prior to our IPO, we recognized changes in the fair value of the common units through increases or decreases in stock-based compensation expense and adjustments to the related stock-based compensation liability. This liability was impacted by changes in the estimated value of the common units, number of vested common units, and distributions made to holders of the common units.  The following table reflects the estimated fair value of the common units during the relevant periods impacting the stock-based compensation expense for the years ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013:   Estimated fair value as of June 30, Common Units 2014  2013  2012   (estimated value per unit) Class A $2.47  $1.50  $0.92 Class B 2.22  1.34  0.81 Class C 1.92  1.14  0.68 Class D 1.86  1.1  0.65 Class E 1.62  0.95  0.55 Class F 1.44  0.75  0.49 Class G 0.82  0.46  n/a Class H  0.70  0.38  n/a Class I 0.45  n/a  n/a Class J 0.33  n/a  n/a Class K 0.29  n/a  n/a ZPS Class A 0.09  0.2  n/a Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $13.7 million, or 4%, to $338.2 million for Fiscal 2014 from $324.5 million for Fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily the result of depreciation related to capital expenditures since June 30, 2013 and acquisition-related growth.46 Total Other Expense, NetThe table below sets forth the components of our total other expense, net for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.   Year ended June 30   2014  2013  $ Variance  % Variance   (in millions) Interest expense $(203.5) $(202.5) $(1.0) * Loss on extinguishment of debt  (1.9)  (77.3)  75.4  * Foreign currency gain on intercompany loans  4.7   0.1   4.6  * Other income, net  0.3   0.3                        —  * Total other expenses, net $(200.4) $(279.4) $79.0   28%*         not meaningful                 Interest Expense.    Interest expense increased by $1.0 million, or less than 1%, to $203.5 million for Fiscal 2014, from $202.5 million for Fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily a result of additional interest expense related to the $150.0 million and $275.0 million add-ons to our Term Loan Facility during the second and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2014, respectively. Also contributing to the increase in interest expense was the impact of changes in market value of our interest rate swaps during the year ended June 30, 2014 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2013. The change in market value was additional interest expense of $4.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 as compared to a reduction in interest expense of $2.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2013, representing a year over year increase in interest expense of $7.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from the amendments to our Credit Agreement during the second and third quarters of Fiscal 2013 and second quarter of Fiscal 2014 to lower the interest rates on our Term Loan Facility and Revolver, in addition to quarterly principal payments on our Term Loan Facility, which reduced our outstanding debt obligations.Loss on Extinguishment of Debt.    In connection with the debt refinancing activities during Fiscal 2014, we recognized an expense of $1.9 million associated with debt extinguishment costs, including a cash expense of $0.9 million associated with the payment of third party costs and non-cash expenses of $1.0 million, consisting of $0.7 million associated with the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and $0.3 million associated with the write-off of the net unamortized discount on the extinguished debt balances.In connection with the debt refinancing activities during the Fiscal 2013, we incurred an expense of $77.3 million associated with debt extinguishment costs, including a cash expense of $41.9 million associated with the payment of early redemption fees and other third party expenses on our previous indebtedness and non-cash expenses, including $35.4 million associated with the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts.Provision for Income TaxesIncome tax expense increased over the prior year by $61.5 million, from an income tax benefit of $24.2 million for Fiscal 2013 to an income tax expense of $37.3 million for Fiscal 2014. Our provision for income taxes included both the current and deferred provision for income tax expense resulting from timing differences between tax and financial reporting accounting bases. In addition, as a result of our pre-IPO stock-based compensation and certain transaction costs not being deductible for income tax purposes, our effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate.The following table reconciles our expected tax benefit based on the statutory federal tax rate applied to our earnings before income taxes to our actual (benefit)/provision for income taxes:47 The following table reconciles our expected tax provision based on the statutory federal tax rate applied to our earnings before income taxes to our actual provision/(benefit) for income taxes:   Year ended June 30,   2014  2013 Expected benefit/provision at the statutory rate $(50.5) $(59.5)Increase/(decrease) due to:        Non-deductible stock-based compensation  96.5   35.9 State income taxes benefit, net of federal benefit  (6.6)  (2.2)Transactions costs not deductible for tax purposes  0.8   1.3 Reversal of uncertain tax positions, net  (2.6) — State NOL adjustment —   2.8 Change in effective tax rate  (0.3) — Change in valuation allowance  1.3  — Foreign tax rate differential  1.0   (2.3)Other, net  (2.3)  (0.2)(Benefit)/provision for income taxes $37.3  $(24.2) Discontinued OperationsOur earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes, of $2.3 million and $8.4 million during Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, respectively, related to the operations of OVS, which we spun off on June 13, 2014.  See Note 4-Spin-off of Business to our consolidated financial statements.  Adjusted EBITDAWe define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings/(loss) from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) adjusted to exclude acquisition or disposal-related transaction costs, losses on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation, unrealized foreign currency gains (losses) on intercompany loans, and non-cash income (loss) on equity and cost method investments.  We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance, and this financial measure is among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting for future periods. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and facilitates comparison of our results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures.We also monitor Adjusted EBITDA because our subsidiaries have debt covenants that restrict their borrowing capacity that are based on a leverage ratio, which utilizes a modified EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding 2020 Unsecured Notes, 2023 Unsecured Notes, and 2025 Unsecured Notes (collectively, the “Notes”). The modified EBITDA is consistent with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA; however, it includes the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of and expected cost synergies from the companies acquired by us during the quarter for which the debt compliance certification is due.Adjusted EBITDA results, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are also utilized by management and our compensation committee for purposes of determining bonus payouts to employees.Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA: •does not reflect capital expenditures, or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments; •does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; •does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service the interest payments, on our debt; and •does not reflect cash required to pay income taxes.Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because all companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.48 Reconciliations from segment and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss)/earnings from continuing operations are as follows:   For the year ended June 30, 2015   Physical Infrastructure  Cloud and Connectivity  Other  Corp/eliminations  Total   (in millions) Segment and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $432.8  $344.5  $5.3  $-  $782.6 Interest Expense  (136.0)  (78.0) —  —   (214.0)Depreciation and amortization expense  (263.6)  (140.7)  (1.9) —   (406.2)Transaction costs  (2.9)  (0.9) —   (2.4)  (6.2)Stock-based compensation  (110.0)  (91.2)  0.5  —   (200.7)Loss on extinguishment of debt  (55.0)  (39.3) —  —   (94.3)Unrealized foreign currency loss on intercompany loans —   (0.3) —   (24.1)  (24.4)Non-cash loss on investments  (0.9) —  —  —   (0.9)Earnings/(loss) from continuing operations before provision for   income tax  (135.6)  (5.9)  3.9   (26.5)  (164.1)Benefit for income taxes —  —  —   8.8   8.8 Net (loss)/earnings $(135.6) $(5.9) $3.9  $(17.7) $(155.3)   For the year ended June 30, 2014   Physical Infrastructure  Cloud and Connectivity  Other  Corp/eliminations  Total   (in millions) Segment and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $324.9  $325.9  $8.0  $(5.2) $653.6 Interest Expense  (121.8)  (81.2) —   (0.5)  (203.5)Depreciation and amortization expense  (205.0)  (131.4)  (1.8) —   (338.2)Transaction costs  (2.8)  (1.0) —   (1.5)  (5.3)Stock-based compensation  (163.4)  (90.0)  (0.3) —   (253.7)Loss on extinguishment of debt  (1.1)  (0.8) —  —   (1.9)Unrealized foreign currency translation gain on intercompany loans —  —  —   4.7   4.7 Earnings/(loss) from continuing operations before provision for   income tax  (169.2)  21.5   5.9   (2.5)  (144.3)Provision for income taxes —  —  —   (37.3)  (37.3)Earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes —  —  —   2.3   2.3 Net (loss)/earnings $(169.2) $21.5  $5.9  $(37.5) $(179.3)   For the year ended June 30, 2013   Physical Infrastructure  Cloud and Connectivity  Other  Corp/eliminations  Total   (in millions) Segment and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $275.7  $277.8  $6.2  $(5.3) $554.4 Interest Expense  (119.0)  (83.5) —  —   (202.5)Depreciation and amortization expense  (183.5)  (139.1)  (1.9) —   (324.5)Transaction costs  (7.2)  (7.0) —  —   (14.2)Stock-based compensation  (46.4)  (58.6)  (0.8) —   (105.8)Loss on extinguishment of debt  (45.1)  (32.2) —  —   (77.3)Unrealized foreign currency translation gain on intercompany loans —  —  —   0.1   0.1 Earnings/(loss) from continuing operations before provision for   income tax  (125.5)  (42.6)  3.5   (5.2)  (169.8)Benefit for income taxes —  —  —   24.2   24.2 Earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes —  —  —   8.4   8.4 Net (loss)/earnings $(125.5) $(42.6) $3.5  $27.4  $(137.2)  Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, equity contributions, and incurrence of debt. Our principal uses of cash have been for acquisitions, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and debt service.49 We have financial covenants under the Indentures governing our Notes and our Credit Agreement that, under certain circumstances, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. The indenture governing our 2020 Unsecured Notes limits any increase in ZGL’s secured indebtedness (other than certain forms of secured indebtedness expressly permitted under such indenture) to a pro forma secured debt ratio of 4.50 times our previous quarter’s annualized modified EBITDA (as defined in the indenture) and limits ZGL’s incurrence of additional indebtedness to a total indebtedness ratio of 5.25 times the previous quarter’s annualized modified EBITDA. The indentures governing the 2023 Unsecured Notes and the 2025 Unsecured Notes limit any increase in ZGL’s secured indebtedness (other than certain forms of secured indebtedness expressly permitted under such indentures) to a pro forma secured debt ratio of 4.50 times ZGL’s previous quarter’s annualized modified EBITDA (as defined in the indentures), and limit ZGL’s incurrence of additional indebtedness to a total indebtedness ratio of 6.00 times the previous quarter’s annualized modified EBITDA.  The Credit Agreement also contains a covenant, applicable only to the Revolver, that ZGL maintain a senior secured leverage ratio below 5.25:1.00 at any time when the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the Revolver is greater than 35% of the commitments under the Revolver. The Credit Agreement also requires ZGL and its subsidiaries to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants restricting the ability of ZGL and its subsidiaries, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness, make additional guaranties, incur additional liens on assets, or dispose of assets, pay dividends, or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay certain other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments and amend the terms of certain other indebtedness.As of June 30, 2015, we had $308.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital surplus of $181.0 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held in bank accounts and highly-liquid U.S. treasury money market funds. Additionally, as of June 30, 2015, we had $440.8 million available under our Revolver, subject to certain conditions.Our capital expenditures, net of stimulus grants, increased by $169.6 million, or 47%, during the year ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2014, to $530.4 million from $360.8 million, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures is a result of meeting the needs of our larger customer base resulting from our acquisitions and organic growth. We expect to continue to invest in our network for the foreseeable future. These capital expenditures, however, are expected to primarily be success-based; that is, in most situations, we will not invest the capital until we have an executed customer contract that supports the investment.As part of our corporate strategy, we continue to be regularly involved in discussions regarding potential acquisitions of companies and assets, some of which may be quite large. We expect to fund such acquisitions with cash from operations, debt issuances (including available borrowings under our $450.0 million Revolver), equity offerings, and available cash on hand. We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business, repay our debt obligations, and support our other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. As market conditions permit, we may refinance existing debt, issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets, or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity.  Cash FlowsWe believe that our cash flows from operating activities, in addition to cash and cash equivalents currently on-hand, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, and in any event for at least the next 12 to 18 months. Given the generally volatile global economic climate, no assurance can be given that this will be the case.We regularly consider acquisitions and additional strategic opportunities, including large acquisitions, which may require additional debt or equity financing.The following table sets forth the components of our cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013.   Year Ended June 30,   2015  2014  2013   (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $605.4  $566.5  $404.9 Net cash used in investing activities $(1,386.1) $(754.1) $(2,804.0)Net cash provided by financing activities $795.7  $392.7  $2,340.0  Net Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesNet cash flows from operating activities increased by $38.9 million to $605.4 million from $566.5 million during the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 50 Net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2015 include the loss from continuing operations of $155.3 million, plus the add backs of non-cash items deducted in the determination of net loss, principally depreciation and amortization of $406.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $200.7 million, foreign currency loss on intercompany loans of $24.4 million and non-cash cash interest expense of $19.7 million plus an add back for $94.3 million associated with a loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit of $13.3 million.  Also contributing to the cash provided by operating activities were additions to deferred revenue of $149.1 million, less amortization of deferred revenue of $72.1 million.  Cash flow during the period was reduced by the net change in working capital components of $51.1 million.  The $51.1 million cash outflow associated with the change in working capital components was primarily driven by increases in trade receivables of $11.2 million, decrease of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $22.1 million and increases in other assets and liabilities of $14.4 million. Net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2014 represents our net loss from continuing operations of $181.6 million, plus the add back to our net loss of non-cash items deducted in the determination of net loss, principally depreciation and amortization of $338.2 million, non-cash interest expense of $22.1 million, the deferred tax provision of $24.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $253.7 million and loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.9 million.  Also contributing to the cash provided by operating activities were additions to deferred revenue of $163.8 million, less amortization of deferred revenue of $55.6 million. Cash flow during the period was increased by the net change in working capital components of $2.6 million.The increase in net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the year ended June, 2014 is primarily a result of additional earnings from organic growth and synergies realized from our Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2015 acquisitions, offset in part by increased interest and tax payments.Net cash flows from operating activities increased by $161.6 million, or 40%, to $566.5 million from $404.9 million during the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2013 represents the loss from continuing operations of $145.6 million, plus the add backs of non-cash items deducted in the determination of net loss, principally depreciation and amortization of $324.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of $105.8 million, losses on extinguishment of debt of $77.3 million, additions to deferred revenue of $61.7 million and non-cash interest expense of $12.3 million, offset by amortization of deferred revenue of $43.1 million and deferred tax benefit of $25.9 million, plus the net change in working capital components. The increase in net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2014 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2013 is primarily a result of additional earnings from our organic growth, a higher volume of upfront IRU payments, cost synergies realized from our acquisitions and interest expense savings from our refinancings.  Cash Flows Used in Investing ActivitiesWe used cash in investing activities of $1,386.1 million, $754.1 million and $2,804.0 million during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.During the year ended June 30, 2015, our principal uses of cash for investing activities were $530.4 million in additions to property and equipment and $855.7 million in net cash paid for acquisitions.During the year ended June 30, 2014, our principal uses of cash for investing activities were $360.8 million in additions to property and equipment and $393.0 million in net cash paid for acquisitions.During the year ended June 30, 2013, our principal uses of cash for investing activities were $323.3 million in additions to property and equipment, net of stimulus grant reimbursements and $2,483.4 million in net cash paid for acquisitions.  Our largest acquisition in Fiscal 2013 was our $2,210.0 million acquisition of AboveNet.Cash Flows Provided By Financing ActivitiesOur net cash provided by financing activities was $795.7 million, $392.7 million and $2,340.0 million during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Our cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2015 are primarily comprised of $1,787.3 million from debt proceeds and $413.7 million of proceeds from equity offerings. These were partially offset by $1,292.0 million of principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations, $62.6 million of early redemption fees on debt extinguished, $24.2 million of debt issuance costs and $26.5 million in direct costs associated with the equity offerings. 51 Our cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2014 are primarily comprised of $423.6 million from debt proceeds, partially offset by $25.9 million of principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations and $4.9 million in debt issuance costs.Our cash flows from financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2013 primarily consist of $3,189.3 million from the proceeds from long-term debt, $343.8 million in equity contributions from CII and $22.6 million in net transfers of cash out of restricted cash accounts. These cash inflows were partially offset by $83.1 million in debt issuance costs, $1,060.5 million in principal repayments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations and $72.1 million in early redemption fees on debt extinguishments.  Contractual Cash ObligationsThe following table represents a summary of our estimated future payments under contractual cash obligations as of June 30, 2015 for continuing operations. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these future payments.   Total  LessThan 1Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  MoreThan 5Years   (in millions) Long-term debt (principal and interest) $4,986.4  $213.8  $393.4  $390.9  $3,988.3 Operating leases $673.9   119.3   162.3   111.6   280.7 Purchase obligations  226.4   226.4                 —                 —                 — Capital leases (principal and interest) $45.1   6.4   12.6   8.8   17.3 Total $5,931.8  $565.9  $568.3  $511.3  $4,286.3  Our operating leases and purchase commitments include expected payments for our operating facilities, network services and capacity, communications equipment, and maintenance obligations. Our purchase commitments are primarily success-based, meaning that before we commit resources to expand our network, we have a signed customer contract that will provide us with an attractive return on the required capital. The contractual long-term debt payments, above, include an estimate of future interest expense based on the interest rates in effect on our floating rate debt obligations as of the most recent balance sheet date.Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, which are reflected in our cash flows from operating activities, during the year ended June 30, 2015 were $191.2 million and represent 32% of our cash flows from operating activities before interest expense. We also made cash payments related to principal payments on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $23.1 million (exclusive of the impact of redemption and refinancing transactions), which are reflected in our cash flows from financing activities, and represent 4% of our cash flows from operating activities.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging, or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not (i) reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements, (ii), or disclosed in Note 14-Commitments and Contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements, or in the Contractual Cash Obligations table included above.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsDebt Issuance CostsOn April 7, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts.  Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were required to be presented as deferred charge assets, separate from the related debt liability. ASU 2015-03 does not change the recognition and measurement requirements for debt issuance costs. The Company early-adopted ASU 2015-03 as of the end of Fiscal 2015, and applied its provisions retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the reclassification of $71.0 million and $89.4 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Company's Notes from other non-current assets to long-term debt within its consolidated balance sheets as of both June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, respectively. 52 Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date to annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date or annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.  Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We have accounting policies that involve estimates such as the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue reserves, useful lives of long-lived assets, fair value of our common and preferred units issued as compensation, accruals for estimated tax and legal liabilities, accruals for exit activities associated with real estate leases, accruals for customer disputes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We have identified the policies below, which require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations.Revenue and Trade ReceivablesWe recognize revenue derived from leasing fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure and the provision of telecommunications and colocation services when the service has been provided and when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue.We often bill customers for upfront charges, which are non-refundable. These charges relate to down payments or prepayments for future services and are influenced by various business factors including how we and the customer agree to structure the payment terms. If the upfront payment made by a customer provides no benefit to the customer beyond the contract term, the upfront charge is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the contract term. If the upfront payment provides benefit to the customer beyond the contract term, the charge is recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the customer relationship.Revenue attributable to leases of dark fiber pursuant to IRUs is accounted for in the same manner as the accounting treatment for sales of real estate with property improvements or integral equipment. This accounting treatment typically results in the deferral of revenue for the cash that has been received and the recognition of revenue ratably over the term of the agreement (generally up to 20 years).Revenue is recognized at the amount expected to be realized, which includes billing and service adjustments. During each reporting period, we make estimates for potential future sales credits to be issued in respect of current revenue related to service interruptions and customer disputes, which are recorded as a reduction in revenue. We analyze historical credit activity when evaluating our credit reserve requirements. We reserve for known service interruptions as incurred. We review customer disputes and reserve against those we believe to be valid claims. The determination of the customer dispute credit reserve involves significant judgment, estimations and assumptions.We defer recognition of revenue until cash is collected on certain components of revenue, principally contract termination charges and late fees.We estimate the ability to collect our receivables by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition, and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on expected collection of our receivables. Our estimates are based on assumptions and other considerations, including payment history, credit ratings, customer financial performance, industry financial performance and aging analysis.53 Stock-Based CompensationWe account for our stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718—Compensation: Stock Compensation, which requires stock compensation to be recorded as either liability or equity awards based on the terms of the grant agreement.CII Common UnitsThe CII common units granted to employees were considered to be stock-based compensation with terms that required the awards to be classified as liabilities due to cash settlement features. Prior to our IPO, we adjusted the value of the vested portion of our common unit liability awards to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. We used a third party valuation firm to assist in the valuation of the CII common units at each reporting period. In developing a value for the common units, a two-step valuation approach was used. In the first step, we estimated the value of our equity through an analysis of valuations associated with various future potential liquidity scenarios. The second step involved allocating these values across our capital structure.We allocated value to each class of common units using the Probability Weighted Expected Return Method (“PWERM”). The unit value was based on a probability-weighted present value of expected future proceeds to our shareholders, considering each potential liquidity scenario available to us as well as preferential rights of each security. The potential scenarios that we considered within the PWERM framework were remaining a private company with the same ownership, a sale or merger, and an initial public offering. The PWERM utilized a variety of assumptions regarding the likelihood of a certain scenario occurring, if the scenario involved a transaction, the potential timing of such an event, and the potential valuation that each scenario might yield.Based on these scenarios, management calculated the probability-weighted expected return to all of the equity holders. The resulting enterprise valuation was then allocated across our capital structure. Upon a liquidation of CII, or upon a non-liquidating distribution, the holders of common units would share in the proceeds after the CII preferred unit holders received their unreturned capital contributions and their priority return (6% per annum). After the preferred unreturned capital contributions and the priority return were satisfied, the remaining proceeds were allocated on a scale ranging from 85% to the Class A preferred unit holders and 15% to the common unit holders to 80% to the preferred unit holders and 20% to the common unit holders depending upon the return multiple to the preferred unit holders, also known as the waterfall allocation.The value attributable to each class of shares was then discounted in order to account for the lack of marketability of the units. In determining the appropriate lack of marketability discount, we evaluated both empirical and theoretical approaches to arrive at a composite range that we believed indicated a reasonable spectrum of discounts for each of the valuation techniques utilized. The empirical methods we evaluated relied on datasets procured from observed transactions in equity interests in the public domain that were perceived to incorporate pricing information related to the marketability (or lack thereof) of the equity interest itself. These empirical methods included initial public offering studies and restricted stock studies. Theoretical models utilized in our analysis formed the primary basis for the discount for lack of marketability, and included the Finnerty Average-Strike Put, the Asian Protective Put and the Black-Scholes-Merton Protective Put.In connection with our IPO and the related amendment to the CII operating agreement, there was a deemed modification to the stock compensation arrangements with our current and former employees and directors. As a result, previously issued common units, which were historically accounted for as liability awards, became classified as equity awards. Prior to reclassifying our common unit liability to equity, we re-measured the fair value of the CII common units factoring in the change in fair value resulting from the passage of time and the change in fair value caused by the modification. The fair value of these previously vested common units was estimated to be $490.2 million on the modification date, and this amount is reflected in our consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity as an increase to additional paid-in capital during the year ended June 30, 2015. The unrecognized compensation associated with unvested CII common units was $70.2 million as of June 30, 2015, which will be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period of the outstanding common units through May 15, 2017.On October 9, 2014, we and CII’s board of managers approved a non-liquidating distribution by CII of shares of our common stock held by CII to holders of CII vested common units. Holders of vested CII common units received shares of our common stock as a distribution in respect of the value of their underlying vested CII common units. Employees with unvested CII common units will continue to receive monthly distributions from CII of our common stock as they vest under the original terms of the CII common unit grant agreements. CII may be required to distribute additional shares of our common stock to CII common unit holders on a quarterly basis through June 30, 2016 based on our stock price performance, subject to the existing vesting provisions of the CII common units. The shares to be distributed to the common unit holders are based on a pre-existing distribution mechanism, whose primary input is our stock price at each subsequent measurement date. Any remaining shares of common stock owned by CII will be distributed to the existing CII preferred unit holders.54 The valuation of the CII common units as of the date of our IPO was determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo valuation analysis attempts to approximate the probability of certain outcomes by running multiple trial runs, called simulations, using random variables to generate potential future stock prices. This valuation technique was used to estimate the fair value associated with future distributions of our common stock to CII common unit holders. The Monte Carlo simulation first projects the number of shares to be distributed by CII to the common unit holders at each subsequent measurement date based on stock price projections under each simulation. Shares attributable to unvested CII common units are subject to the existing vesting provisions of the CII common unit awards. The estimated future value of shares scheduled to be distributed by CII based on vesting provisions are calculated under each independent simulation. The present value of the number of shares of common stock to be distributed to common unit holders under each simulation is then computed, and the average of each simulation is the fair value of our common stock to be distributed by CII to the common unit holders. This value was then adjusted for prior non-liquidating distributions made by us to derive a value for CII common units by class and on a per unit basis. These values were used to calculate the fair value of outstanding CII common units as of the IPO date. Various inputs and assumptions were utilized in the valuation method, including forfeiture behavior, vesting provisions, holding restrictions, peer companies’ historical volatility, and an appropriate risk-free rate.Performance Incentive Compensation PlanIn October 2014, our Board of Directors adopted the 2014 Performance Compensation Incentive Plan (“PCIP”). The PCIP includes incentive cash compensation and equity (in the form of restricted stock units or “RSUs”). Grants of RSUs under the PCIP plan are made quarterly for all participants. The PCIP went into effect on October 16, 2014.The PCIP has two components: Part A and Part B.Part AUnder Part A of the PCIP, all full-time employees, including our executives, are eligible to earn quarterly awards of RSUs. Each participant in Part A of the PCIP will have a target RSU annual award value, which will be allocated each fiscal quarter. The number of Part A RSUs granted will be calculated based on the final award value determined by the Compensation Committee divided by the average closing price of our common stock over the last ten trading days of the respective performance quarter. Part A RSUs will cliff vest based upon continued employment through the end of the fourth full fiscal quarter ending after the grant date of the Part A RSU. Thereafter, the RSUs will be converted for an equal number of shares in our common stock.Each quarterly Part A award is recorded as a liability as of the end of the respective measurement quarter, as the awards represent an obligation denominated in a fixed dollar amount to be settled in a variable number of shares during the subsequent quarter. Upon the issuance of the RSUs, the liability is re-measured, representing the vested portion of the fair value of the actual number of RSUs issued, and the liability is then reclassified to additional paid-in capital. The remaining unvested value is expensed through the respective vesting date.Part BUnder Part B of the PCIP, participants, who include members of our senior management team, are awarded quarterly grants of RSUs. The number of the RSUs earned by the participants is based on our stock price performance over a four fiscal quarter measurement period and Part B RSUs cliff vest based upon continued employment at the end of the measurement period. The existence of a vesting provision that is associated with the performance of our stock price is a market condition, which affects the determination of the grant date fair value. Upon vesting, RSUs convert to shares of our common stock.The grant date fair value of Part B awards issued during a given period are expensed over the performance period. The grant date fair value is estimated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation, which uses randomly generated stock-price paths through a Geometric Brownian Motion stock price simulation. This simulation provides a stochastic projection of the ten-day average closing stock price ending on the vesting date (i.e., end of performance period), the total stock price performance over the performance period, and the number of common shares to be issued at the vesting date. Various assumptions are utilized in the valuation method, including the target stock price performance ranges and respective share payout percentages, our historical stock price performance and volatility, peer companies’ historical volatility and an appropriate risk-free rate. The aggregate future value of the grant under each simulation is calculated using the estimated per share value of the common stock at the end of the restriction period multiplied by the number of common shares projected to be granted at the vesting date. The present value of the aggregate grant is then calculated under each simulation resulting in a distribution of potential present values. The average of this present value distribution equals the fair value of the grant.55 Property and EquipmentWe record property and equipment acquired in connection with a business combination at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. See “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: Acquisitions—Purchase Price Allocation.” Purchases of property and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred. Costs incurred prior to a capital project’s completion are reflected as construction-in-progress and are part of network infrastructure assets. Depreciation begins once the property and equipment is available and ready for use. Certain internal direct labor costs of constructing or installing property and equipment are capitalized. Capitalized direct labor reflects a portion of the salary and benefits of certain field engineers and other employees that are directly related to the construction and installation of network infrastructure assets. We have contracted with third party contractors for the construction and installation of the majority of our fiber network. Depreciation and amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, with the exception of leasehold improvements, which are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease.Estimated useful lives of our property and equipment in years are as follows: Land N/ABuildings improvements and site improvements 15 to 20Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 3 to 7Computer hardware 3 to 5Software 3Machinery and equipment 5 to 7Fiber optic equipment 8Circuit switch equipment 10Packet switch equipment 5Fiber optic network 15 to 20Construction in progress N/A We perform periodic internal reviews to estimate useful lives of our property and equipment. Due to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment, selecting the estimated economic life of telecommunications property and equipment requires a significant amount of judgment. Our internal reviews take into account input from our network services personnel regarding actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, and assumptions regarding the benefits and costs of implementing new technology that factor in the need to meet our financial objectives.When property and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in operating income.From time to time, we are required to replace or re-route existing fiber due to structural changes such as construction and highway expansions, which is defined as a “relocation.” In such instances, we fully depreciate the remaining carrying value of network infrastructure removed or rendered unusable, and capitalize the new fiber and associated construction costs of the relocation placed into service. To the extent that the relocation does not require the replacement of components of our network, and only involves the act of moving our existing network infrastructure, as-is, to another location, the related costs are expensed as incurred.Interest costs are capitalized for all assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use. This policy is based on the premise that the historical cost of acquiring an asset should include all costs necessarily incurred to bring it to the condition and location necessary for its intended use. In principle, the cost incurred in financing expenditures for an asset during a required construction or development period is itself a part of the asset’s historical acquisition cost. The amount of interest costs capitalized for qualifying assets is determined based on the portion of the interest cost incurred during the assets’ acquisition periods that theoretically could have been avoided if expenditures for the assets had not been made. The amount of interest capitalized in an accounting period is calculated by applying the capitalization rate to the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the period. The capitalization rates used to determine the value of interest capitalized in an accounting period is based on our weighted average effective interest rate for outstanding debt obligations during the respective accounting period.We periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets and evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets. We consider various factors to determine if an impairment test is necessary. The factors include: consideration of the overall economic climate, technological advances with respect to equipment, our strategy, and capital planning. Since our inception, no event has occurred nor has there been a change in the business environment that would trigger an impairment test for our property and equipment assets.56 Deferred Tax AssetsDeferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant being: tax losses that can be carried forward to be utilized against taxable income in future years; and expenses recognized in our income statement but disallowed in our tax return until the associated cash flow occurs.We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be recognized. The amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is influenced by management’s assessment of our future taxable income with regard to relevant business plan forecasts, the reversal of deferred tax balances, and reasonable tax planning strategies. At each balance sheet date, existing assessments are reviewed and, if necessary, revised to reflect changed circumstances. In a situation where recent losses have been incurred, the relevant accounting standards require convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future taxable income.In connection with several of our acquisitions, we have acquired significant net operating loss carry forwards (“NOLs”). The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the utilization of NOLs if there has been an “ownership change” as described in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.Upon acquiring a company that has NOLs, we prepare an assessment to determine if we have a legal right to use the acquired NOLs. In performing this assessment we follow the regulations within the Internal Revenue Code Section 382: Net Operating Loss Carryovers Following Changes in Ownership. Any disallowed NOLs acquired are written-off in purchase accounting.A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the period and/or of the character necessary to utilize the benefit of the deferred tax asset. When evaluating whether it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized, all available evidence, both positive and negative, that may affect the realizability of deferred tax assets is identified and considered in determining the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance. We continue to monitor our financial performance and other evidence each quarter to determine the appropriateness of our valuation allowance. If we are unable to meet our taxable income forecasts in future periods we may change our conclusion about the appropriateness of the valuation allowance which could create a substantial income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations in the period such change occurs.As of June 30, 2015, we had a cumulative federal (U.S.) NOL carry forward balance of $1,145.2 million. During the year ending June 30, 2015, we utilized $95.6 million of NOL carry forwards that were available to offset future taxable income.  Our NOL carry forwards, if not utilized to reduce taxable income in future periods, will expire in various amounts beginning in 2020 and ending in 2032. As a result of Internal Revenue Service regulations, we are currently limited to utilizing a maximum of $511.8 million of acquired NOL carry forwards during Fiscal 2015; however, to the extent that we do not utilize $511.8 million of our acquired NOL carry forwards during a fiscal year, the difference between the $511.8 million maximum usage and the actual NOLs usage is carried over to the next calendar year. Of our $1,145.2 million NOL carry forwards balance, $957.0 million of these NOL carry forwards were acquired in acquisitions. The deferred tax assets recognized at June 30, 2015 have been based on future profitability assumptions over a five-year horizon.The analysis of our ability to utilize our NOL balance is based on our forecasted taxable income. The forecasted assumptions approximate our best estimates, including market growth rates, future pricing, market acceptance of our products and services, future expected capital investments, and discount rates. Although our forecasted income includes increased taxable earnings in future periods, flat earnings over the period in which our NOL carry forwards are available would result in full utilization of our current unreserved NOL carry forwards.Goodwill and Purchased IntangiblesWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in April, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates.Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively “customer relationships”), are initially recorded at fair value. We amortize customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of ten to twenty years using the straight-line method, as this method approximates the timing in which we expect to receive the benefit from the acquired customer relationship assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.57 Our impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test. Additionally, each reporting unit’s fair value is assessed in light of certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity- and reporting unit-specific events. If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in acquisition accounting. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments and estimates.Our impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves comparing the estimated fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. To the extent the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value, we will recognize an impairment loss for the difference.Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We recorded no impairment charges for goodwill or intangibles during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014, or 2013.Acquisitions – Purchase Price AllocationWe apply the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given, liabilities incurred, and equity instruments issued. Identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over our interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If our interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds the cost of the acquisition, a gain is recognized in earnings on the acquisition date only after we have reassessed whether we have correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed.For certain of our larger acquisitions, we engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships, tradenames, property and equipment and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, after the acquisition closing date through the end of the measurement period (up to one year) as we finalize valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.The determination and allocation of fair values to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment. The most significant variables in these valuations are discount rates, terminal values, the number of years on which to base the cash flow projections, and the assumptions and estimates used to determine cash inflows and outflows or other valuation techniques (such as replacement cost). We determine which discount rates to use based on the risk inherent in the related activity’s current business model and industry comparisons. Terminal values are based on the expected life of products, forecasted life cycle and forecasted cash flows over that period. Although we believe that the assumptions applied in the determination are reasonable based on information available at the date of acquisition, actual results may differ from the estimated or forecasted amounts and the difference could be material.  58 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates from time to time and market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our cash flows and earnings.As of June 30, 2015, we had outstanding $350.0 million 2025 Unsecured Notes, $1,430.0 million 2023 Unsecured Notes and $325.6 million 2020 Unsecured Notes (collectively, the “Notes”), a balance of $1,646.8 million on our Term Loan Facility, and $32.7 million of capital lease obligations. As of June 30, 2015, we had $440.8 million available for borrowing under our Revolver.On April 17, 2015, we entered into a Seventh Amendment to our Credit Agreement governing our Term Loan Facility and the Revolver which increased our borrowing capacity on the Revolver from $250.0 million to $450.0 million.Based on current market interest rates for debt of similar terms and average maturities and based on recent transactions, we estimate the fair value of our Notes to be $2,109.3 million as of June 30, 2015. Our 2025 Unsecured Notes, 2023 Unsecured Notes and 2020 Unsecured Notes accrue interest at fixed rates of 6.375%, 6.00% and 10.125%, respectively.Both our Revolver and our Term Loan Facility accrue interest at floating rates subject to certain conditions. As of June 30, 2015, the applicable interest rate on our Revolver was 3.0% and the rate on our Term Loan Facility was 3.75%. A hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rate on our Term Loan Facility of one percentage point would increase our annual interest expense by only 0.283% or $4.7 million, which is limited as a result of the applicable interest rate as of June 30, 2015 being below the Credit Agreement’s 1.0% LIBOR floor. A hypothetical increase of one percentage point above the LIBOR floor would increase the Company’s annual interest expense by approximately $16.5 million before considering the offsetting effects of our interest rate swaps.In August 2012, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $750.0 million and a maturity date of June 30, 2017. The contract states that we pay a 1.67% fixed rate of interest for the term of the agreement, beginning June 30, 2013. The counterparties pay to us the greater of actual LIBOR or 1.25%. We entered into the swap arrangements to reduce the risk of increased interest costs associated with potential future increases in LIBOR rates. A hypothetical increase in LIBOR rates of 100 basis points would increase the fair value of our interest rate swaps by approximately $7.3 million.We are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates if it is necessary to seek additional funding to support the expansion of our business and to support acquisitions. The interest rate that we may be able to obtain on future debt financings will be dependent on market conditions.We have exposure to market risk arising from foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended June 30, 2015, our foreign activities accounted for 11% of our consolidated revenue. We monitor foreign markets and our commitments in such markets to assess currency and other risks. Currently, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates do not pose a material risk, a 1% increase in foreign exchange rates would change consolidated revenue by approximately $1.5 million. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangement designed to limit exposure to foreign currencies. Because of our more recent European expansion related to the Geo and Neo acquisitions, our level of foreign activities is expected to increase and if it does, we may determine that such hedging arrangements would be appropriate and will consider such arrangements to minimize our exposure to foreign exchange risk. We do not have any material commodity price risk.ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATAReference is made to the information set forth beginning on page F-1.ITEM 9.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS (1) ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESSZayo Group Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on November 13, 2007, and is the parent company of a number of subsidiaries engaged in bandwidth infrastructure provision and services. Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as “Zayo Group Holdings” or the “Company.” The Company’s primary operating subsidiary is Zayo Group LLC (“ZGL”). Headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, the Company operates bandwidth infrastructure assets, including fiber networks and datacenters, in the United States and Europe to offer: •Physical infrastructure, including dark fiber, mobile infrastructure and colocation services. •Cloud and Connectivity, previously referred to as Lit Services, including wavelengths, Ethernet, IP, SONET and Cloud services. •Other services, including Zayo Professional Services.Stock Split and Amended and Restated Certificate of IncorporationOn October 9, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 223,000-for-one stock split of the Company’s common stock. The stock split became effective upon filing of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation on October 10, 2014. Immediately subsequent to the stock split, 223,000,000 shares of common stock were outstanding. All of the shares outstanding and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.On October 10, 2014, the Company filed its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to authorize the issuance of additional shares of common and preferred stock, establish related voting and holding rights for these shares, and address certain other matters related to corporate governance.Initial Public OfferingPrior to its initial public offering (“IPO”), Zayo Group Holdings was wholly owned by Communications Infrastructure Investments, LLC (“CII”). On October 22, 2014, the Company completed an IPO of 24,079,002 shares of common stock at an offering price of $19 per share. Shares sold in the IPO consisted of 16,008,679 shares sold by the Company and 8,070,323 shares sold by selling stockholders (including CII investors and employees, former employees, and directors and officers of the Company). Proceeds to the Company after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses totaled approximately $282.0 million, and net proceeds to selling stockholders, including the exercised underwriter option, totaled approximately $150.2 million. In March 2015, the Company completed a follow-on equity offering selling 4,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $27.35 per share. Proceeds of the follow-on equity offering to the Company after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses totaled approximately $105.2. Proceeds to the Company from the IPO and follow-on equity offering are recorded as an increase in common stock and additional paid-in-capital, net of direct offering costs (including previously capitalized amounts), during the second and third quarters of Fiscal 2015. The Company’s shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on October 17, 2014 under the ticker symbol “ZAYO”.    (2) BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESa. Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include all the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company have been included herein.  Unless otherwise noted, dollar amounts and disclosures throughout the Notes to the consolidated financial statements relate to the Company's continuing operations and are presented in millions of dollars.Our fiscal year ends June 30 each year, and we refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 as “Fiscal 2015,” June 30, 2014 as “Fiscal 2014,” and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as “Fiscal 2013.”F-8 b. Earnings or Loss per ShareBasic earnings or loss per share attributable to the Company’s common shareholders is computed by dividing net earnings or loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.   Diluted earnings or loss per share attributable to common shareholders presents the dilutive effect, if any, on a per share basis of potential common shares (such as restricted stock units) as if they had been vested or converted during the periods presented.  No such items were included in the computation of diluted loss per share for the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 because the Company incurred a loss from continuing operations in each of these periods and the effect of inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.c. Foreign Currency TranslationFor operations outside the U.S. that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, and revenue, expenses and cash flows are translated using monthly average exchange rates during the year. Gains or losses resulting from currency translation are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in member’s equity and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. The Company considers the majority of its investments in its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested. d. Discontinued OperationsOn June 13, 2014, the Company completed a spin-off of Onvoy, LLC and its subsidiaries (“OVS”) to CII. The spin-off is reported as an equity distribution at carryover basis equal to the net assets and liabilities of OVS on the spin-off date, as the transaction was between entities under common control. See Note 4—Spin-off of Business.e. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used when establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and accruals for billing disputes, determining useful lives for depreciation and amortization and accruals for exit activities associated with real estate leases, assessing the need for impairment charges (including those related to intangible assets and goodwill), determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, accounting for income taxes and related valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and estimating the common unit and restricted stock unit grant fair values used to compute the stock-based compensation liability and expense. Management evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and makes estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditionsf. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted CashThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Restricted cash consists of cash balances held by various financial institutions as collateral for letters of credit and surety bonds. These balances are reclassified to cash and cash equivalents when the underlying obligation is satisfied, or in accordance with the governing agreement. Restricted cash balances expected to become unrestricted during the next twelve months are recorded as current assets. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company had a non-current restricted cash balance of $4.8 million and $5.1 million respectively.g. Trade ReceivablesTrade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in its trade receivable portfolio. In establishing the required allowance, management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and the customer’s financial condition, and the age of receivables and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.h. Property and EquipmentThe Company’s property and equipment includes assets in service and under construction or development.F-9 Property and equipment is recorded at historical cost or acquisition date fair value. Costs associated directly with network construction, service installations, and development of business support systems, including employee-related costs, are capitalized. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life from the date placed into service or acquired. Management periodically evaluates the estimates of the useful life of property and equipment by reviewing historical usage, with consideration given to technological changes, trends in the industry, and other economic factors that could impact the network architecture and asset utilization.Equipment acquired under capital leases is recorded at the lower of the fair value of the asset or the net present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease. Depreciation of equipment held under capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense, and is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the related lease term, whichever is shorter.Management reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its property and equipment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the assets’ carrying value exceeds both the assets’ estimated undiscounted future cash flows and the assets’ estimated fair value. Measurement of the impairment loss is then based on the estimated fair value of the assets. Considerable judgment is required to project such future cash flows and, if required, to estimate the fair value of the property and equipment and the resulting amount of the impairment. No impairment charges were recorded for property and equipment during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 or 2013.The Company capitalizes interest for assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use. The amount of interest capitalized is based on the Company’s weighted average effective interest rate for outstanding debt obligations during the respective accounting period.i. Goodwill and Acquired IntangiblesIntangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships, (collectively “customer relationships”), are initially recorded at fair value. The Company amortizes customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of 10 to 20 years, using the straight-line method as this method approximates the timing in which the Company expects to receive the benefit from the acquired customer relationship assets.  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually in April, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates. The Company’s impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test. Additionally, each reporting unit’s fair value is assessed in light of certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity- and reporting unit-specific events. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments and estimates. If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in acquisition accounting. The residual amount after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a combination of both income and market-based variation approaches. The inputs and assumptions to valuation methods used to estimate the fair value of reporting units involves significant judgments. The Company reviews its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in April and involves comparing the estimated fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. To the extent the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value, the Company will recognize an impairment loss for the difference. The Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of these assets was in excess of the carrying value for the year ended June 30, 2015, 2014 or 2013 and has concluded there is no indication of impairment.Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. No impairment charges were recorded for goodwill or intangibles during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 or 2013.F-10 j. Derivative Financial InstrumentsDerivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. The Company has historically entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt and has not applied hedge accounting; therefore, the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recognized in earnings as adjustments to interest expense. The principal objectives of the derivative instruments are to minimize the cash flow interest rate risks associated with financing activities. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts in connection with debt instruments entered into during the July 2012 financing transactions. k. Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenues derived from leasing fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure and the provision of telecommunications and colocation services when the service has been provided and when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, customer acceptance has been obtained with relevant contract terms, and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to a governmental authority are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenue.Most revenue is billed in advance on a fixed-rate basis and the remainder is billed in arrears on a transactional basis determined by customer usage. The Company often bills customers for upfront charges, which are non-refundable. These charges relate to activation fees, installation charges or prepayments for future services and are influenced by various business factors including how the Company and customer agree to structure the payment terms.  These upfront charges are deferred and recognized over the underlying contractual term. The Company also defers costs associated with customer activation and installation to the extent of upfront amounts received from customers, which are recognized as expense over the same period for which the associated revenue is recognized.The Company typically records revenues from leases of dark fiber, including indefeasible rights-of-use (“IRU”) agreements, over the term that the customer is given exclusive access to the assets. Dark fiber IRU agreements generally require the customer to make a down payment upon the execution of the agreement with monthly IRU fees paid over the contract term; however, in some cases, the Company receives up to the entire lease payment at the inception of the lease and recognizes the revenue ratably over the lease term. Revenue related to professional services to provide network management and technical support is recognized as services are provided.In determining the appropriate amount of revenue and related reserves to reflect in its consolidated financial statements, management evaluates payment history, credit ratings, customer financial performance, and historical or potential billing disputes and related estimates are based on these factors and assumptions.l. Operating Costs and ExpensesThe Company’s operating costs and expenses consist primarily of network expense (“Netex”), compensation and benefits, network operations expense (“Netops”), stock-based compensation, other expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Netex consists of third-party network service costs resulting from the leasing of certain network facilities, primarily leases of circuits and dark fiber, from carriers to augment the Company’s owned infrastructure, for which it is generally billed a fixed monthly fee. Netex also includes colocation facility costs for rent and license fees paid to the landlords of the buildings in which the Company’s colocation business operates, along with the utility costs to power those facilities. Compensation and benefits expenses include salaries, wages, incentive compensation and benefits. Employee-related costs that are directly associated with network construction, service installations and development of business support systems are capitalized and amortized to operating costs and expenses over the customer life. Compensation and benefits expenses related to the departments attributed to generating revenue are included in “Operating costs” while compensation and benefits expenses related to the sales, product, and corporate departments are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations. Netops expense include all of the non-personnel related expenses of operating and maintaining the network infrastructure, including contracted maintenance fees, right-of-way costs, rent for cellular towers and other places where fiber is located, pole attachment fees, and relocation expenses. Netops expense is included in “Operating costs” in the consolidated statements of operations. F-11 Stock-based compensation expense consists of the fair value of equity based awards granted to employees and independent directors over their applicable vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is included, based on the responsibilities of the awarded recipient, in either “Operating costs” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations. For additional information regarding our stock-based compensation expense, see Note 12 – Stock-Based Compensation.Other expenses include expenses such as property tax, franchise fees, and colocation facility maintenance, which relate to operating our network and are therefore included in “Operating costs” as well as travel, office expense and other administrative costs that are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses”. Other expenses are included in either “Operating costs” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statement of operations depending on their relationship to generating revenue or association with sales and administration.Transaction costs include expenses associated with professional services (i.e. legal, accounting, regulatory, etc.) rendered in connection with acquisitions or disposals (including spin-offs), travel expense, severance expense incurred on the date of acquisition or disposal, and other direct expenses incurred that are associated with signed and/or closed acquisitions or disposals. Transaction costs are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations. Related to Netex, the Company recognizes the cost of these facilities or services when it is incurred in accordance with contractual requirements. The Company routinely disputes incorrect billings. The most prevalent types of disputes include disputes for circuits that are not disconnected on a timely basis and usage bills with incorrect records. Depending on the type and complexity of the issues involved, it may take several quarters to resolve disputes. In determining the amount of such operating expenses and related accrued liabilities to reflect in its consolidated financial statements, management considers the adequacy of documentation of disconnect notices, compliance with prevailing contractual requirements for submitting such disconnect notices and disputes to the provider of the facilities, and compliance with its interconnection agreements with these carriers. Significant judgment is required in estimating the ultimate outcome of the dispute resolution process, as well as any other costs that may be incurred to conclude the negotiations or settle any litigation.  m. Stock-Based CompensationIn October 2014, the Company adopted a new incentive plan.  The plan includes incentive cash compensation (ICC) and equity (in the form of restricted stock units).  Grants under the new incentive plan are made quarterly for all participants. The Company recognizes all stock-based awards to employees and independent directors, based on their grant-date fair values and the Company’s estimates of forfeitures. The Company recognizes the fair value of outstanding awards as a charge to operations over the vesting period. The Company uses the straight-line method to recognize share-based compensation expense for outstanding share awards that do not contain a performance condition.Prior to the Company’s IPO, the Company was given authorization by CII to award 625,000,000 of CII’s common units as profits interests to employees, directors, and affiliates of the Company.  The common units were historically considered to be stock-based compensation with terms that required the awards to be classified as liabilities due to cash settlement features. The vested portion of the awards was reported as a liability and the fair value was re-measured at each reporting date until the date of settlement, with a corresponding charge (or credit) to stock-based compensation expense.  In connection with the Company’s IPO and the related amendment to the CII operating agreement, there was a deemed modification to the stock compensation arrangements with the Company’s employees and directors. As a result, previously issued common units which were historically accounted for as liability awards, became classified as equity awards.Determining the fair value of certain share-based awards at the grant date and subsequent reporting dates requires judgment. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted.For additional information regarding our stock-based compensation, see Note 12 – Stock-Based Compensation. n. Legal CostsCosts incurred to hire and retain external legal counsel to advise us on regulatory, litigation and other matters is expensed as the related services are received.F-12 o. Income TaxesThe Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.Estimating the future tax benefit associated with deferred tax assets requires significant judgment. Deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant being: tax losses that can be carried forward to be utilized against taxable income in future years; and expenses recognized in the Company’s financial statements but disallowed in the Company’s tax return until the associated cash flow occurs.The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be recognized. The valuation allowance is established if, based on available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the period and/or of the character necessary to utilize the benefit of the deferred tax asset. When evaluating whether it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized, all available evidence, both positive and negative, that may affect the realizability of deferred tax assets is identified and considered in determining the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance. The Company continues to monitor its financial performance and other evidence each quarter to determine the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation allowance. At each balance sheet date, existing assessments are reviewed and, if necessary, revised to reflect changed circumstances.The analysis of the Company’s ability to utilize its NOL balance is based on the Company’s forecasted taxable income. The forecasted assumptions approximate the Company’s best estimates, including market growth rates, future pricing, market acceptance of the Company’s products and services and future expected capital investments. If the Company is unable to meet its taxable income forecasts in future periods the Company may change its conclusion about the appropriateness of the valuation allowance which could create a substantial income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations in the period such change occurs.Deferred tax liabilities related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration are not recognized until it becomes apparent that such amounts will reverse in the foreseeable future.The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in the provision for income taxes.p. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsRelevant accounting literature defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. It also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques that may be used include the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow) and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost), which are each based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions.Fair Value HierarchyA fair value hierarchy is established that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of inputs that are used to measure fair value are:Level 1Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.Level 2Inputs to the valuation methodology include: •quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;F-13  •quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; •inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and •inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.Level 3Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.The Company views fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, management considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.q. Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash investments and accounts receivable. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in commercial bank accounts in the United States and Great Britain. The Company limits its cash investments to high-quality financial institutions in order to minimize its credit risk.During the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 the Company had no single customer that exceeded 10% of total revenue. The Company’s trade receivables, which are unsecured, are geographically dispersed. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company had one customer with a trade receivable balance of 10% and 12%, respectively, of total receivables. r. Condensed Financial Information of the RegistrantThe restricted net assets of Zayo Group Holdings exceeds 25% of its consolidated net assets due to restrictions under the Credit Agreement and Notes (as defined in Note 8 – Long-term debt).  Zayo Group Holdings is a holding company with no assets or liabilities of its own or operations other than those of its subsidiary ZGL. Accordingly, the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss and cash flows of Zayo Group Holdings and ZGL are the same, except that at June 30, 2015 Zayo Group Holdings had cash of $0.6 million and deferred tax assets of $14.9 million related to net operating loss carry forwards and other tax attributes retained from the OVS spin-off. As such, the condensed financial information of Zayo Group Holdings is not presented as it is not meaningful.s. Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsDebt Issuance CostsIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts.  Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were required to be presented as deferred charge assets, separate from the related debt liability. ASU 2015-03 does not change the recognition and measurement requirements for debt issuance costs. The Company early-adopted ASU 2015-03 as of the end of Fiscal 2015, and applied its provisions retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the reclassification of $71.0 million and $89.4 million of unamortized debt issuance costs (see Note 8 – Long Term Debt) from other non-current assets to a reduction in Long-term debt, non-current within its consolidated balance sheets as of both June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, respectively. F-14 Revenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date to annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date or annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.  (3) ACQUISITIONSSince inception, the Company has consummated 34 transactions accounted for as business combinations. The acquisitions were executed as part of the Company’s business strategy of expanding through acquisitions. The acquisitions of these businesses have allowed the Company to increase the scale at which it operates, which in turn affords the Company the ability to increase its operating leverage, extend its network reach, and broaden its customer base.The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired entities from their respective acquisition dates.Acquisitions Completed During Fiscal 2015Neo Telecoms (“Neo”)On July 1, 2014, the Company acquired a 96% equity interest in Neo, a Paris-based bandwidth infrastructure company.

As additional information becomes known concerning the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, management may make adjustments to the opening balance sheet of the acquired company up to the end of the measurement period, which is no longer than a one year period following the acquisition date. The determination of the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed (and the related determination of estimated lives of depreciable tangible and identifiable intangible assets) requires significant judgment. As of June 30, 2015, the Company has not completed its fair value analysis and calculations in sufficient detail necessary to arrive at the final estimates of the fair value of certain working capital and non-working capital acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including the allocations to property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, deferred revenue and resulting deferred taxes related to its acquisitions of IdeaTek and Latisys. All information presented with respect to certain working capital and non-working capital acquired assets and liabilities assumed as it relates to these acquisitions are preliminary and subject to revision pending the final fair value analysis.

The allocation was determined based on the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed that were assigned to the reporting units.  Note 6 - Goodwill, displays the allocation of the Company's acquired goodwill to each of its reporting units.Purchase Accounting Estimates Associated with Deferred TaxesThe Company acquired material deferred tax assets and/or liabilities in its acquisitions of Latisys, Geo and AboveNet. Based on the Company’s fair value assessment related to deferred tax assets acquired in the Latisys, Geo and AboveNet acquisitions, a value of $(83.6) million, $(38.2) million, and $42.1 million, respectively, was assigned to the acquired net deferred tax (liabilities)/asset.In conjunction with the acquisition accounting for Latisys and AboveNet, the Company completed a “change in ownership” analysis, within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Section 382 of the IRC limits an acquiring company’s ability to utilize net operating loss carry forwards (“NOLs”) previously generated by an acquired company in order to reduce future taxable income. As a result of the Company’s acquisition of Latisys and AboveNet, the Company is subject to annual limitations on usage of the acquired $126.3 million and $1,008.8 million of NOLs generated by Latisys and AboveNet prior to the acquisition date.F-19 The tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows (in millions):   Latisys  Geo  AboveNet   February 23, 2015  May 16, 2014  July 2, 1012 Deferred income tax assets:            Net operating loss carryforwards $49.9  $2.5  $405.3 Deferred revenue  1.1   4.4   49.1 Accrued expenses  0.1  —   12.2 Allowance for doubtful accounts  0.3  —   2.5 Other  0.4  —  — Total deferred income tax assets  51.8   6.9   469.1 Deferred income tax liabilities:            Property and equipment  (42.3)  (32.9)  (250.0)Intangible assets  (93.1)  (12.2)  (177.0)Total deferred income tax liabilities  (135.4)  (45.1)  (427.0)Net deferred income tax asset/(liabilities) $(83.6) $(38.2) $42.1  Adjustments to Purchase Accounting Estimates Associated with Prior Year AcquisitionsDuring Fiscal 2015, the Company finalized its acquisition accounting for acquisitions consummated during Fiscal 2014 resulting in adjustments to previously reported allocation of the purchase consideration associated with its Fiscal 2014 acquisitions.  The adjustments were a result of changes to the original fair value estimates of certain items acquired. These changes are the result of additional information obtained since June 30, 2014 that related to facts and circumstances that existed at the respective acquisition dates. The Company has recast the previously reported consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2014 in connection with the finalization of acquisition accounting for these acquisitions. The Company did not recast the previously reported consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2014 due to the immaterial effect of the related adjustments. The following table reflects the financial statement captions impacted by the purchase accounting adjustments:    AdjustedBalanceJune 30, 2014  Previously Reported Balance*June 30, 2014  Purchase accounting adjustment Assets            Current assets            Trade receivables, net  57.2   59.0   (1.8)Prepaid expenses  24.9   25.6   (0.7)Total current assets  82.1   84.6   (2.5)Property and equipment, net  2,822.4   2,821.4   1.0 Intangible assets, net  710.3   709.7   0.6 Goodwill  866.7   845.3   21.4 Other assets  39.9   39.7   0.2 Total assets $4,521.4  $4,500.7  $20.7              Liabilities            Current liabilities            Accrued liabilities  175.1   162.5   12.6 Total current liabilities  175.1   162.5   12.6 Capital lease obligation, non-current  25.8   22.9   2.9 Deferred revenue, non-current  501.4   496.9   4.5 Deferred income taxes, net  135.6   134.9   0.7 Total liabilities $837.9  $817.2  $20.7  *As reported on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on March 13, 2015F-20 Transaction CostsTransaction costs include expenses associated with professional services (i.e., legal, accounting, regulatory, etc.) rendered in connection with signed and/or closed acquisitions or disposals (including spin-offs), travel expense, severance expense incurred on the date of acquisition or disposal, and other direct expenses incurred that are associated with such acquisitions or disposals. The Company incurred transaction costs of $6.2 million, $5.3 million, and $14.2 million, during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Transaction costs have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows during these periods.Pro-forma Financial Information (Unaudited)The pro forma results presented below include the effects of the Company’s Fiscal 2015 and 2014 acquisitions as if the acquisitions occurred on July 1, 2013. The pro forma net loss for the periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 includes the additional depreciation and amortization resulting from the adjustments to the value of property and equipment and intangible assets resulting from purchase accounting and adjustment to amortized revenue during Fiscal 2015 and 2014 as a result of the acquisition date valuation of assumed deferred revenue. The pro forma results also include interest expense associated with debt used to fund the acquisitions. The pro forma results do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma financial information below is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisitions been consummated as of July 1, 2013.   Year Ended June 30,   2015  2014 Revenue $1,420.2  $1,323.0 Net loss $(182.7) $(226.1) The Company is unable to determine the amount of revenue associated with each acquisition recognized in the post-acquisition period as a result of integration activities.  (4) SPIN-OFF OF BUSINESSOn June 13, 2014, the Company completed a spin-off of OVS, a company that provides voice and managed services. Prior to the spin-off, on March 7, 2014, OVS converted from a corporation to a limited liability company. At that time, certain tax attributes were retained by the Company in connection with the conversion, primarily deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards totaling $13.7 million. On the spin-off date, the remaining net assets of OVS were distributed to CII.The spin-off is reported as an equity distribution at carryover basis equal to the net assets and liabilities of OVS on the spin-off date, as the transaction was between entities under common control.The Company determined that all significant cash flows and continuing involvement associated with the operations of OVS were discontinued. The results of operations of OVS are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented and are presented net of intercompany eliminations.Earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are comprised of the following:   Period Ended June 30, 2014  Year Ended June 30, 2013 Revenues $75.7  $80.2 Earnings before income taxes $10.0  $17.0 Income tax expense  7.7   8.6 Earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes $2.3  $8.4   F-21 (5) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENTProperty and equipment, including assets held under capital leases, was comprised of the following (in millions):   Estimated          useful lives As of June 30,   (in years) 2015  2014 Land N/A $16.2  $0.7 Building leasehold and site improvements 15 to 20  109.2   64.7 Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 3 to 7  5.1   5.7 Computer hardware 3 to 5  15.1   16.7 Software 3  8.3   9.3 Machinery and equipment 5 to 7  272.1   94.9 Fiber optic equipment 8  623.3   583.7 Circuit switch equipment 10  12.1   11.8 Packet switch equipment 5  76.2   62.8 Fiber optic network 15 to 20  2,715.4   2,450.8 Construction in progress N/A  437.1   259.0 Total    4,290.1   3,560.1 Less accumulated depreciation    (990.9)  (737.7)Property and equipment, net   $3,299.2  $2,822.4  Total depreciation expense, including depreciation of assets held under capital leases, for the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $351.4 million, $294.2 million and $280.1 million, respectively.During the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company capitalized interest in the amounts of $12.5 million, $12.6 million and $13.0 million, respectively.

(“Zayo Capital”) issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior secured first-priority notes due 2020 (the “2020 Secured Notes”) and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “2020 Unsecured Notes”, and together with the 2020 Secured Notes, the “2020 Notes”). On July 2, 2012, ZGL also entered into a $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and a $1,620.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”), both of which have been subsequently amended (the “Credit Agreement”). The Term Loan Facility was issued at a discount of $30.0 million and has a maturity date of July 2019. The issue discount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The terms of the amended Term Loan Facility require the Company to make quarterly principal payments of $5.1 million plus an annual payment of up to 50% of excess cash flow, as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement (no such payment was required during the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively).  A portion of the net proceeds from the Existing Notes and the Term Loan Facility, together with cash on hand and equity contributions (See Note 11—Equity ), were used to extinguish the Company’s prior term loan facility and revolver, to finance the cash tender offer for and subsequent redemption of the Company’s prior senior secured notes, to pay the cash consideration for the AboveNet acquisition, and to pay associated fees and expenses. In connection with the debt extinguishment activities discussed above, the Company recognized an expense in July 2012 of $65.0 million associated with debt extinguishment costs, including a cash expense of $39.8 million associated with the payment of early redemption fees on the Company’s previous indebtedness and non-cash expenses of $17.0 million associated with the write-off of the Company’s unamortized debt issuance costs and $8.2 million associated with writing-off the net unamortized discount on the debt balances extinguished. On October 5, 2012, ZGL and Zayo Capital entered into a second amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement governing its Term Loan Facility and Revolver. Under the terms of the Second Amendment, effective October 5, 2012, the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was adjusted to bear an interest rate at LIBOR plus 4.0% (subject to a 5.25% floor), which represented a decrease of 187.5 basis points from the original Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment also reduced the interest rate on the Revolver by 187.5 basis points. F-24 On February 27, 2013, ZGL and Zayo Capital entered into a Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Company’s Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Fourth Amendment, effective February 27, 2013, the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was further adjusted to bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.5% (subject to a 4.5% floor). The amended terms represent a downward adjustment of 50 basis points on the spread and a further 25 basis point reduction minimum floor. Under the terms of the Fourth Amendment, the Revolver bore interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%, based on ZGL’s current leverage ratio, which represented a 50 basis point reduction. The Fourth Amendment also amended certain terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement, including removing the senior secured and total leverage maintenance covenants and increasing the total leverage ratio required to be met in order to incur certain additional indebtedness from 5.00:1.00 to 5.25:1.00 as a multiple of EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement).In connection with the aforementioned amendments, the Company incurred early redemption call premiums of $16.2 million and $16.1 million for the Second Amendment and Fourth Amendment, respectively. The early redemption call premiums were paid with cash on hand to the syndicate of creditors in the Term Loan Facility. Prior to the consummation of the amendments, the Company requested the consent of all creditors holding balances in the Term Loan Facility to the amended terms. $15.3 million and $15.0 million of the early call premium paid to consenting creditors in the Second and Fourth Amendments, respectively, were accounted for as additional debt issuance costs for the modified obligations during the year ended June 30, 2013, which are being amortized over the term of the Term Loan Facility using the effective interest method. The remaining call premium of $0.9 million and $1.1 million associated with the Second and Fourth Amendments, respectively, that was paid to non-consenting creditors has been recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended June 30, 2013. Existing and/or new creditors replaced the non-consented commitments, such that the full amount of the Term Loan Facility’s commitments were replaced in both the Second and Fourth Amendments. In connection with the Second and Fourth Amendments, the Company recognized an expense of $12.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2013 associated with debt extinguishment costs. The loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the amendments includes the aforementioned early call premiums paid to non-consenting creditors, non-cash expense associated with the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and issuance discounts on the debt balances accounted for as an extinguishment, and certain fees paid to third parties involved in the amendments.  On November 26, 2013, ZGL and Zayo Capital entered into a Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Company’s Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Fifth Amendment, the Term Loan Facility was increased by $150.0 million to $1,749.8 million and the interest rate was adjusted to LIBOR plus 3.0% with a minimum LIBOR rate of 1.0%. The amended terms represented a downward adjustment of 50 basis points on the interest rate from the Fourth Amendment. The interest rate on the Revolver was amended to LIBOR plus 2.75% (based on ZGL’s then current leverage ratio), which represented a downward adjustment of 25 basis points on the interest rate from the Fourth Amendment. In connection with the Fifth Amendment, the Company did not incur a re-pricing premium.Also, in connection with the Fifth Amendment, the Company recognized an expense during the second quarter of Fiscal 2014 of $1.9 million associated with debt extinguishment costs, including cash expense of $1.0 million related to third party costs and non-cash expense of $0.9 million associated with the write-off of the Company’s unamortized debt issuance costs and discount on the Term Loan Facility accounted for as an extinguishment. The Company also incurred an additional $1.5 million in debt issuance costs in the second quarter of Fiscal 2014.On May 16, 2014, ZGL and Zayo Capital Inc. entered into a Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Per the terms of the Sixth Amendment, the Company’s Term Loan Facility was increased by $275.0 million to $2,015.9 million and bears interest at the existing rate of LIBOR plus 3.0 percent with a minimum LIBOR rate of 1.0 percent. The $275.0 million add-on was priced at 99.5 percent. No other terms of the Credit Agreement were amended. In connection with the Sixth Amendment, the Company incurred an additional $3.2 million in debt issuance costs and $1.4 million was recorded as a discount. On December 15, 2014, the Company redeemed $75.0 million of its outstanding 2020 Secured Notes at a price of 108.125% of the principal amount and $174.4 million of its outstanding 2020 Unsecured Notes at a price of 110.125% (collectively, the “December Notes Redemption”). As part of the Note Redemption, the Company recorded an early redemption call premium of $23.8 million which has been recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of operations in Fiscal 2015.  F-25 On January 23, 2015, the ZGL and Zayo Capital (together “the Issuers”) completed a private offering (the “January Notes Offering”) of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2023 (the “2023 Unsecured Notes”).  On March 9, 2015, the Issuers completed a private offering of an additional $730.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Unsecured Notes at a premium of 1% (the “March Notes Offering”, and together with the January Notes Offering, the “2023 Notes Offerings”) resulting in aggregate gross proceeds for the 2023 Unsecured Notes of $1,437.3 million.  The issue premium of $7.3 million on the March Notes Offerings is being accreted against interest expense over the term of the notes under the effective interest method.  The 2023 Unsecured Notes bear interest at the rate of 6.00% per year, which is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2015. The 2023 Unsecured Notes will mature on April 1, 2023.  The net proceeds from the January Notes Offering were used to fund the Latisys acquisition (see Note 3 – Acquisitions).   The net proceeds from the March Notes Offering were used to redeem the Company’s remaining $675.0 million 2020 Secured Notes (the “Second Note Redemption”) at a price of 105.75%. As part of the Second Notes Redemption, we recorded an early redemption call premium of $38.8 million.  The call premium has been recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended June 30, 2015. On April 17, 2015, ZGL entered into a Seventh Amendment (the “Seventh Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Per the terms of the Seventh Amendment, the Revolver was increased by $200.0 million to $450.0 million, and its maturity date was extended to the earliest of (i) five years after the effective date of the Seventh Amendment, (ii) six months prior to the maturity date of the Company’s Term Loan Facility, subject to amendment thereof, and (iii) six months prior to the maturity date of the Company’s 2020 Unsecured Notes, subject to repayment or amendment thereof.  The Seventh Amendment also increased the letter of credit commitment from $30.0 to $50.0 and provided that, in the event that the Term Loan Facility was amended or refinanced to remove all financial maintenance covenants, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio maintenance requirement would be replaced with a springing Senior Secured Leverage Ratio maintenance requirement applicable only to the Revolver. Further, pursuant to the Seventh Amendment, up to $50.0 of revolving loans and letters of credit may be denominated in or issued in, as applicable, Euros or British Pound Sterling. Further, pursuant to the Seventh Amendment, up to $50.0 million of revolving loans and letters of credit may be denominated in or issued in, as applicable, Euros or British Pound Sterling. On May 6, 2015, ZGL and Zayo Capital issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due in 2025 (the “2025 Senior Unsecured Notes”). Interest on the 2025 Unsecured Notes is payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2015. The 2025 Unsecured Notes will mature on May 15, 2025.  The net proceeds from the 2025 Senior Unsecured Notes were used to repay $344.5 million of the Company’s Term Loan Facility. As a result of the repayment, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million.  On May 6, 2015, ZGL entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement whereby the Credit Agreement was amended and restated in its entirety. The amended and restated Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of all of the outstanding term loans under the Term Loan Facility to May 6, 2021. The interest rate margins applicable to the Term Loan Facility were decreased by 25 basis points to LIBOR plus 2.75% with a minimum LIBOR of 1.0%. In addition, the amended and restated Credit Agreement removed the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant and replaced such covenant with a springing Senior Secured Leverage Ratio maintenance requirement applicable only to the Revolver, increased certain lien and debt baskets, and removed certain covenants related to collateral.Interest rates on the Term Loan Facility and Revolver as of June 30, 2015 were 3.75% and 3.0%, respectively.  As of June 30, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolver. Standby letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of $9.2 million as of June 30 2015, leaving $440.8 million available under the Revolver as of June 30, 2015. The Revolver is subject to a i) fee per annum of 0.25% to 0.375% (based on the Company’s current leverage ratio) of the weighted-average unused capacity and ii) the undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit backed by the Revolver are subject to a 0.25% fee per annum. Outstanding letters of credit backed by the Revolver accrue interest at a rate ranging from LIBOR plus 2.0% to LIBOR plus 3.0% per annum based upon the Company’s leverage ratio. The Revolver has a maturity date of January 2020.  Debt covenants The indentures (the “Indentures”) governing the 2020 Unsecured Notes, the 2023 Unsecured Notes and the 2025 Unsecured Notes (collectively the “Notes”) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of ZGL and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to any equity interests, make certain investments or other restricted payments, create liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of the ZGL’s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to ZGL, consolidate or merge with or into other companies or transfer all or substantially all of their assets, engage in transactions with affiliates, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions.  The terms of the Indentures include customary events of default.F-26 The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including among others, non-payment of principal, interest, or other amounts when due, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, breach of covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, insolvency or inability to pay debts, bankruptcy, or a change of control. The Credit Agreement also contains a covenant, applicable only to the Revolver, that ZGL maintain a senior secured leverage ratio below 5.25:1.00 at any time when the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the Revolver is greater than 35% of the commitments under the Revolver.The Indentures governing the 2020 Unsecured Notes limit any increase in the ZGL’s secured indebtedness (other than certain forms of secured indebtedness expressly permitted under the indentures) to a pro forma secured debt ratio of 4.50 times the Company’s previous quarter’s annualized modified EBITDA, as defined in the Indentures, and limit the Company’s incurrence of additional indebtedness to a total indebtedness ratio of 5.25 times the previous quarter’s annualized modified EBITDA. The indentures governing the 2023 Unsecured Notes and the 2025 Unsecured Notes limit any increase in ZGL’s secured indebtedness (other than certain forms of secured indebtedness expressly permitted under such indentures) to a pro forma secured debt ratio of 4.50 times ZGL’s previous quarter’s annualized modified EBITDA (as defined in the indentures), and limit ZGL’s incurrence of additional indebtedness to a total indebtedness ratio of 6.00 times the previous quarter’s annualized modified EBITDA. The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with its debt agreements as of June 30, 2015 and 2014.Redemption rightsAt any time prior to May 15, 2018 (for the 2025 Unsecured Notes), April 1, 2018 (for the 2023 Unsecured Notes) and July 1, 2016 (for the 2020 Unsecured Notes) the Company may redeem all or part of the applicable Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus (ii) accrued interest and a “make-whole” premium, which is a lump sum payment derived from a formula based on the net present value of future coupon payments that will not be paid because of the early redemption.    On or after May 1, 2020 (for the 2025 Unsecured Notes),  April 1, 2018 (for the 2023 Unsecured Notes) or July 1, 2016 (for the 2020 Unsecured Notes), the Company may redeem all or part of the applicable Notes, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount and set forth below), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, thereon, to the applicable redemption date, subject to the rights of the holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if redeemed during the 12-month period of the years indicated below: Year Redemption Price(2020 Unsecured Notes) 2016  105.063% 2017  102.531% 2018 and thereafter  100.000%  Year Redemption Price(2023 Unsecured Notes) 2018  104.500% 2019  103.000% 2020  101.500% 2021 and thereafter  100.000%  Year Redemption Price(2025 Unsecured Notes) 2020  103.188% 2021  102.125% 2022  101.063% 2023 and thereafter  100.000%  The Company may purchase the Notes in open-market transactions, tender offers, or otherwise. The Company is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.F-27 Aggregate future contractual maturities of long-term debt (excluding issue discounts and premiums) were as follows as of June 30, 2015 (in millions): Year Ended June 30,    2016 $16.5 2017  16.5 2018  16.5 2019  16.5 2020  16.5 Thereafter  3,669.9 Total $3,752.4  GuaranteesThe Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by all of the ZGL’s current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries. The Notes were co-issued with Zayo Capital, which does not have independent assets or operations.Debt issuance costsIn connection with the Credit Agreement (and subsequent amendments thereto), and the various Note offerings, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $99.3 million (net of extinguishments). These costs are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the underlying debt instruments using the effective interest method, unless extinguished earlier, at which time the related unamortized costs are to be immediately expensed. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $23.2 million, $0.7 million and $42.3 million associated with the Company’s previous indebtedness were recorded as part of the loss on extinguishment of debt during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.   The balance of debt issuance costs as of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 was $71.0 million and $89.4 million, net of accumulated amortization of $28.3 million and $25.4 million, respectively. The amortization of debt issuance costs is included on the consolidated statements of cash flows within the caption “Non-cash interest expense” along with the amortization or accretion of the premium and discount on the Company’s indebtedness and changes in the fair value of the Company’s interest rate derivatives.  Interest expense associated with the amortization of debt issuance costs was $13.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 and $11.5 million during the year ended June 30, 2013.Debt issuance costs are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to “Long-term debt, non-current”. Interest rate derivativesOn August 13, 2012, the Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $750.0 million, a maturity date of June 30, 2017, and a start date of June 30, 2013. There were no up-front fees for these agreements. The contract states that the Company shall pay a 1.67% fixed rate of interest for the term of the agreement beginning on the start date. The counter-party will pay to the Company the greater of actual LIBOR or 1.25%. The Company entered in to the forward-starting swap arrangements to reduce the risk of increased interest costs associated with potential changes in LIBOR rates. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps are recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the applicable period. The fair value of the interest rate swaps of $4.1 million and $2.0 million are included in “Other long term liabilities” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, $2.1 million, $4.6 million and $(2.6) were recorded as an increase/(decrease) in interest expense for the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps.  F-28 (9) INCOME TAXESThe Company’s (benefit)/provision for income taxes from continuing operations are summarized as follows (in millions): The United States and foreign components of (loss)/benefit from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows (in millions):   Year Ended June 30,   2015  2014  2013 Current Income Taxes            Federal $1.7  $6.2  $— State  4.4   3.6   1.7 Foreign  (1.6)  3.3  — Total $4.5  $13.1  $1.7 Deferred Income Taxes            Federal $(8.7) $23.8  $(25.7)State  (6.9)  1.0   (3.7)Foreign  2.3   (0.6)  3.5 Total  (13.3)  24.2   (25.9)Total (benefit)/provision for income taxes $(8.8) $37.3  $(24.2) The United States and foreign components of loss from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows (in millions):   Year Ended June 30,   2015  2014  2013 United States $(159.7) $(135.3) $(185.6)Foreign $(4.4) $(9.0) $15.8 Total $(164.1) $(144.3) $(169.8) The Company’s effective income tax rate differs from what would be expected if the federal statutory rate were applied to earnings before income taxes primarily because of certain expenses that represent permanent differences between book and tax expenses and deductions, such as the stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s CII common units that is recorded as an expense for financial reporting purposes but is not deductible for tax purposes.A reconciliation of the actual income tax provision and the tax computed by applying the U.S. federal rate to the earnings before income taxes during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in millions):   Year ended June 30,   2015  2014  2013 Expected benefit/provision at the statutory rate $(57.4) $(50.5) $(59.5)Increase/(decrease) due to:            Non-deductible stock-based compensation  59.4   96.5   35.9 State income taxes benefit, net of federal benefit  (7.4)  (6.6)  (2.2)Transactions costs not deductible for tax purposes  0.7   0.8   1.3 Reversal of uncertain tax positions, net —   (2.6) — State NOL adjustment —  —   2.8 Change in effective tax rate  (2.2)  (0.3) — Change in valuation allowance —   1.3  — Foreign tax rate differential  0.6   1.0   (2.3)Other, net  (2.5)  (2.3)  (0.2)(Benefit)/provision for income taxes $(8.8) $37.3  $(24.2) F-29 Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

It utilized approximately $95.6 million during Fiscal 2015.  The Company has completed several acquisitions in which it acquired net operating loss tax attributes as part of the purchase.  These acquisitions, however, were considered a ""change in ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and, as a result, such NOL carry forwards are subject to an annual limitation, reducing the amount available to offset income tax liabilities absent the limitation.  Currently available NOL carry forwards as of June 30, 2015 are approximately $511.8 million.  An additional $189.3 million will become available for use during fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  The Company's NOL carry forwards, if not utilized to reduce taxable income in future periods, will expire in various amounts beginning in 2020 and ending in 2032.As of June 30, 2015, the Company had approximately $11.6 million of foreign jurisdiction net operating loss carry forwards, primarily in France.  The majority of these foreign jurisdiction net operating loss carry forwards do not expire.As of June 30, 2015, the Company had tax-effected state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $42.8 million, which are subject to limitations on their utilization and have various expiration dates through 2032.Management believes it is more likely than not that it will utilize its net deferred tax assets to reduce or eliminate tax payments in future periods, with the exception of deferred tax assets related to a foreign subsidiary. The Company’s evaluation encompassed (i) a review of its recent history of taxable income for the past three years and (ii) a review of internal financial forecasts demonstrating its expected ability to fully utilize its deferred tax assets prior to expiration.Release of Accrual for Uncertain Tax PositionDuring Fiscal 2014, the Company released an accrual of $2.6 million related to an uncertain tax position previously recognized in connection with the FiberNet acquisition upon settlement of the matter with the Internal Revenue Service. The uncertain tax position was associated with a deduction taken for accelerated vesting of restricted stock units. This reduced the Company's estimated effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. The remaining accrual was recorded as a reduction of the deferred tax assets associated with the Company's net operating loss carry forwards.Unrecognized tax benefits represent the aggregate tax effect of differences between tax return positions and the amounts otherwise recognized in the Company’s financial statements, and as a result of the substantial NOL carry forwards, are netted against the Company’s deferred tax asset balance in the consolidated balance sheets.F-30 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions):   Year Ended June 30, 2014 Balance, beginning of year $6.4 Decreases  (6.4)Balance, end of year $—   (10) ACCRUED LIABILITIESAccrued liabilities included in current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):    Year Ended June 30,   2015  2014 Accrued compensation and benefits $19.4  $13.3 Accrued property and equipment purchases  54.7   46.2 Network expense accruals  77.2   79.2 Other accrued taxes  12.7   9.4 Accrued professional fees  3.4   6.6 Other accruals  14.8   20.4 Total $182.2  $175.1   (11) EQUITYPrior to October 16, 2014, the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of CII. CII was organized on November 6, 2006, and subsequently capitalized on May 7, 2007, with capital contributions from various institutional and founder investors. Prior to October 16, 2014, the Company was controlled by the CII board of managers, which was in turn controlled by the members of CII in accordance with the rights specified in CII’s operating agreement. At formation, 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, were issued to CII by the Company. On October 9, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a 223,000-for-one split of the Company’s common stock that was effective upon the filing of the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation on October 10, 2014. Subsequent to the stock split and prior to the Company’s IPO, 223,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 were outstanding and are retroactively reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.As part of the Company’s IPO in October 2014, the Company sold 16,008,679 shares of its common stock at a price of $19.00 per share for $304.2 million in gross proceeds.  The Company incurred costs directly associated with the IPO of $22.2 million.  In March 2015, the Company completed a follow-on equity offering selling 4,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $27.35 per share for $109.5 million in gross proceeds. The Company incurred costs directly associated with the follow-on offering of $4.3 million.  Proceeds from the IPO and the follow-on equity offering (net of issuance costs) of $387.2 million are reflected on the Company’s consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity during the year ended June 30, 2015.During the year ended June 30, 2015, there was a deemed modification to the Company’s stock compensation arrangements with employees and directors.  The modification resulted in a reclassification of the previously recorded stock-based compensation liability to additional paid-in capital (see Note 12 – Stock-Based Compensation). As discussed in Note 12—Stock-Based Compensation, during the quarter ended December 31, 2013, the Board of CII authorized a non-liquidating distribution to certain common unit holders of up to $10.0 million and advanced $10.0 million to CII, evidenced by an intercompany note receivable. During the quarter ended March 31, 2014, the Board of CII authorized and paid a non-liquidating distribution to the Company’s CEO for $3.0 million and amended the intercompany note receivable with CII for the incremental distribution. During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Board of CII authorized and paid a non-liquidating distribution to a member of management for $9.0 million in full and final settlement of his outstanding common unit grants and further amended the intercompany note receivable with CII for the incremental distribution. The amount due from CII is reflected as a reduction of stockholder’s equity as of June 30, 2014.On October 16, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with CII which relieved CII of its obligation to repay the Company the outstanding intercompany note receivable balance of $22.0 million. The cancelation of the intercompany note receivable with CII is reflected on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity during the year ended June 30, 2015 as a decrease to additional paid-in-capital of $22.0 million and an offsetting decrease to the note receivable from shareholder.F-31 As discussed in Note 4—Spin-Off of Business, during the year ended June 30, 2014, the Company spun off OVS to CII with a corresponding non-cash distribution to CII totaling $31.8 million. As discussed in Note 3—Acquisitions, CII issued 301,949 preferred units with an estimated fair value of $1.6 million in connection with the Corelink acquisition during the first quarter of Fiscal 2014. In connection with and prior to the acquisition of AboveNet, CII concluded the sale of 98,916,060.11 Class C Preferred Units of CII pursuant to certain securities purchase agreements with new private investment funds, as well as certain existing owners of CII and other investors. The total value of the Class C Preferred Units of CII sold pursuant to the securities purchase agreements was approximately $470.3 million, net of $2.0 million in costs associated with raising the additional equity. In June 2012, $133.2 million of the proceeds (net of fees) from the equity raised was contributed to the Company, and the remaining $337.1 million was contributed during the year ended June 30, 2013.  (12) STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONThe following tables summarize the Company’s stock-based compensation expense for liability and equity classified awards included in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions).   Year Ended June 30, Included in: 2015  2014  2013 Operating costs $23.3  $20.2  $7.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses  177.4   233.5   98.2 Total stock-based compensation expense $200.7  $253.7  $105.8              CII Common units $156.4  $253.3  $104.9 CII Preferred units  0.4   0.4   0.9 Part A restricted stock units  12.6   —   — Part B restricted stock units  31.3   —   — Total stock-based compensation expense $200.7  $253.7  $105.8  As of year ended June 30, 2015, there were 933,217 Part A RSUs outstanding and 1,249,873 Part B target RSUs outstanding.CII Common UnitsPrior to the Company’s IPO, the Company was given authorization by CII to award 625,000,000 of CII’s common units as profits interests to employees, directors, and affiliates of the Company.  The common units were historically considered to be stock-based compensation with terms that required the awards to be classified as liabilities due to cash settlement features. The vested portion of the awards was reported as a liability and the fair value was re-measured at each reporting date until the date of settlement, with a corresponding charge (or credit) to stock-based compensation expense.  In connection with the Company’s IPO and the related amendment to the CII operating agreement, there was a deemed modification to the stock compensation arrangements with the Company’s employees and directors. As a result, previously issued common units which were historically accounted for as liability awards, became classified as equity awards.  Prior to reclassifying the common unit liability to equity, the Company re-measured the fair value of the CII common units factoring in the change in fair value since September 30, 2014 and the change in fair value caused by the modification.  The fair value of these previously vested common units was estimated to be $490.2 million on the modification date and this amount is reflected in the Company’s consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity as an increase to additional-paid-in-capital during the year ended June 30, 2015.   The fair value of the unrecognized compensation expense associated with unvested CII common units is being recognized over the remaining vesting period of the Company’s outstanding common units through May 15, 2017.On October 9, 2014, the Company and CII’s board of managers approved a non-liquidating distribution by CII of shares of the Company's common stock held by CII to holders of CII vested common units. Employees and independent directors of the Company with vested CII common units received shares of the Company’s common stock equal in value to the underlying value of their vested CII common units. The total number of shares of the Company’s common stock that were distributed to CII common unit holders in connection with this non-liquidating distribution was 20,460,047 shares.F-32 Employees with unvested CII common units have and/or will continue to receive monthly distributions from CII of the Company’s common stock as they vest under the original terms of the CII common unit grant agreements.  A total of 6,353,302 shares of the Company’s common stock associated with unvested CII common units that have or will be distributed subsequent to the IPO date. In addition, CII has and may in the future be required to distribute additional shares of the Company’s common stock to CII common unit holders on a quarterly basis based on the Company’s stock price performance through June 30, 2016 results, subject to the existing vesting provisions of the CII common units. The shares to be distributed to the common unit holders are based on a pre-existing distribution mechanism, whose primary input is the Company’s stock price at each subsequent measurement date.  Any remaining shares of common stock owned by CII will be distributed to the existing CII preferred unit holders.  The total number of shares of the Company’s common stock that have or will be distributed to existing CII preferred or common unit holders subsequent to the IPO date is 10,294,867 shares.The valuation of the CII common units as of the IPO date was determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation.  The Monte Carlo valuation analysis attempts to approximate the probability of certain outcomes by running multiple trial runs, called simulations, using random variables to generate potential future stock prices. This valuation technique was used to estimate the fair value associated with future distributions of common stock to CII common unit holders. The Monte Carlo simulation first projects the number of shares to be distributed by CII to the common unit holders at each subsequent measurement date based on stock price projections under each simulation. Shares attributable to unvested CII common units are subject to the existing vesting provisions of the CII common unit awards.  The estimated future value of shares scheduled to be distributed by CII based on vesting provisions are calculated under each independent simulation. The present value of the number of shares of common stock to be distributed to common unit holders under each simulation is then computed, and the average of each simulation is the fair value of the Company’s common shares to be distributed by CII to the common unit holders. This value was then adjusted for prior non-liquidating distributions made by the Company to derive a value for CII common units by class and on per unit basis. These values were used to calculate the fair value of outstanding CII common units as of the IPO date. Various inputs and assumptions were utilized in the valuation method, including forfeiture behavior, vesting provisions, holding restrictions, peer companies’ historical volatility, and an appropriate risk-free rate.During the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized $156.4 million, $253.3 million and $104.9 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to vesting of CII common units. As of June 30, 2015, the unrecognized compensation associated with unvested CII common units was $70.2 million.CII Preferred UnitsCII has issued preferred units of CII to certain of the Company’s executives and independent directors as compensation. The terms of these preferred unit awards require the Company to record the awards as equity awards. The Company estimates the fair value of these equity awards on the grant date and recognizes the related expense over the vesting period of the awards. As these awards have been issued by CII to employees and directors of the Company as compensation, the related expense has been recorded by the Company in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense and a related increase to the Company’s additional paid-in capital of $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.In connection with the non-liquidating distribution by CII approved on October 9, 2014, the Company’s CEO and independent directors with vested CII preferred units received 256,265 shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the underlying value of their vested CII preferred units. A total of 29,555 shares of the Company’s common stock associated with unvested CII preferred units have or will be distributed subsequent to the IPO date. Performance Incentive Compensation Plan (“PCIP”)During October 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Performance Compensation Incentive Plan (“PCIP”).  The PCIP includes incentive cash compensation (ICC) and equity (in the form of restricted stock units or “RSUs”).  Grants under the PCIP RSU plans are made quarterly for all participants. The PCIP was effective on October 16, 2014 and will remain in effect for a period of 10 years (or through October 16, 2024) unless it is earlier terminated by the Company’s Board of Directors.The PCIP has two components: Part A and Part B.F-33 Part AUnder Part A of the PCIP, all full-time employees, including the Company’s executives, are eligible to earn quarterly awards of RSUs. Each participant in Part A of the PCIP will have a RSU annual award target value, which will be allocated to each fiscal quarter. The final Part A value awarded to a participant for any fiscal quarter is determined by the Compensation Committee subsequent to the end of the respective performance period taking into account the Company’s measured value creation for the quarter, as well as such other subjective factors that it deems relevant (including group and individual level performance factors). The number of Part A RSUs granted will be calculated based on the final award value determined by the Compensation Committee divided by the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over the last ten trading days of the respective performance period. Part A RSUs will vest assuming continuous employment fifteen months subsequent to the end of the performance period. Upon vesting, the RSUs convert to an equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock.During the years ended June 30, 2015 the Company recognized $12.6 million of compensation expense associated with the vested portion of the Part A awards. The June 30, 2015 quarterly award is recorded as a liability totaling $1.9 million as of June 30, 2015, as the awards represent an obligation denominated in a fixed dollar amount to be settled in a variable number of shares during the quarter ending September 30, 2015. Upon the issuance of the RSUs, the liability is re-measured and then reclassified to additional paid-in capital, with a corresponding charge (or credit) to stock based compensation expense. The value of the remaining unvested RSUs is expensed ratably through the vesting date. At June 30, 2015, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost to be expensed over the remaining vesting period for Part A awards is $12.6 million.Part BUnder Part B of the PCIP, participants, who include members of the Company’s senior management team, are awarded quarterly grants of RSUs. The number of the RSUs earned by the participants is based on the Company’s stock price performance over a four fiscal quarter measurement period and vest, assuming continuous employment at the end of the measurement period. The existence of a vesting provision that is associated with the performance of the Company’s stock price is a market condition, which affects the determination of the grant date fair value.  Upon vesting, RSUs earned convert to an equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock.The table below reflects the total Part B RSUs granted during each period presented, the maximum eligible shares of the Company’s stock that the respective Part B RSU grant could be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock and the grant date fair value per Part B RSU (in millions):   During the three months ended   June 30, 2015  March 31, 2015  December 31, 2014 Part B RSUs granted  316,353   359,658   575,660 Maximum eligible shares of the Company's stock  1,490,023   1,381,086   2,210,534 Grant date fair value per Part B RSU $27.10  $24.36  $63.12  During years ended June 30, 2015, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $31.3 million related to Part B awards.The grant date fair value of Part B RSU grants is estimated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation.  This simulation estimates the ten-day average closing stock price ending on the vesting date, the stock price performance over the performance period, and the number of common shares to be issued at the vesting date. Various assumptions are utilized in the valuation method, including the target stock price performance ranges and respective share payout percentages, the Company’s historical stock price performance and volatility, peer companies’ historical volatility and an appropriate risk-free rate. The aggregate future value of the grant under each simulation is calculated using the estimated per share value of the common stock at the end of the vesting period multiplied by the number of common shares projected to be granted at the vesting date. The present value of the aggregate grant is then calculated under each of the simulations, resulting in a distribution of potential present values. The fair value of the grant is then calculated based on the average of the potential present values. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost associated with Part B RSU grants is $21.9 million at June 30, 2015.  (13) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, accounts payable, interest rate swaps, and long-term debt. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, and accounts payable approximated their fair values at June 30, 2015 and 2014, due to the short maturity of these instruments.F-34 The carrying value of the Company’s Notes, excluding debt issuance costs, reflects the original amounts borrowed, inclusive of unamortized premium was $2,112.7 million and $1,250.0 million as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Based on market interest rates for debt of similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of the Company's Notes as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 was estimated to be $2,109.3 million and $1,294.8 million, respectively. The Company’s fair value estimates associated with its Note obligations were derived utilizing Level 2 inputs – quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.The carrying value of the Company’s Term Loan Facility, excluding debt issuance costs, reflects the original amounts borrowed, net of the unamortized discounts was $1,627.0 million and $1,990.2 million as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company’s Term Loan Facility accrues interest at variable rates based upon the one month, three month or six month LIBOR (with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%) plus a spread of 2.75%. Since management does not believe that the Company’s credit quality has changed significantly since the date when the Term Loan Facility last amended on May 6, 2015, its carrying amount approximates fair value. Excluding any offsetting effect of the Company’s interest rate swaps, a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rate on the Company’s term loan of one percentage point above the 1.0% LIBOR floor would increase the Company’s annual interest expense by approximately $16.5 million.The Company’s interest rate swaps are valued using discounted cash flow techniques that use observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, forward rates, and credit ratings. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps of $2.1 million and $4.6 million were recorded as an increase to interest expense during the year ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, respectively.  A hypothetical increase in LIBOR rates of 100 basis points would favorably increase the fair value of the interest rate swaps by approximately $7.3 million.As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, there is no balance currently outstanding under the Company's Revolver.Financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):   Level June 30, 2015  June 30, 2014 Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value in the Financial Statements:          Interest rate swap Level 2 $4.1  $2.0  Prior to the deemed modification of the Company’s stock-based compensation arrangements (See Note 12 – Stock-based Compensation), the Company recorded its stock based compensation liability at fair value.  The fair value of the Company’s stock-based compensation liability as of June 30, 2014 was $392.4 million and was derived utilizing Level 3 inputs.  (14) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESCapital LeasesFuture contractual payments under the terms of the Company’s capital lease obligations were as follows (in millions): Year Ended June 30,    2016 $6.4 2017  7.0 2018  5.6 2019  5.0 2020  3.8 Thereafter  17.3 Total minimum lease payments  45.1 Less amounts representing interest  (12.4)Less current portion  (4.4)Capital lease obligations, non-current $28.3  Operating LeasesThe Company leases office space, warehouse space, network assets, switching and transport sites, points of presence and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Lease expense was $125.3 million, $90.1 million, and $87.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.F-35 For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the Company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. When the straight-line expense recorded exceeds the cash outflows during the respective period, the Company records a deferred lease obligation on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the respective leases.Minimum contractual lease payments due under the Company’s long-term operating leases are as follows (in millions): Year Ended June 30,    2016 $119.3 2017  86.9 2018  75.4 2019  62.7 2020  48.9 Thereafter  280.7   $673.9  Lease Termination CostsIn connection with integration activities associated with acquisitions completed during Fiscal 2012 and 2013, the Company completed an analysis of existing and acquired facilities leases and determined that certain facilities under lease would not be used by the Company in the future. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a charge for lease termination costs totaling $10.4 million related to exit activities initiated for unutilized space associated with leased office and technical facilities, which was partially offset by a benefit related to the release of associated rent escalation accrual in the amount of $0.2 million. The net $10.2 million charge has been included in operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2013. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the remaining lease termination obligation associated with these facilities was $6.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively, which is recorded net of anticipated sublease income.   The Company periodically re-evaluates its assumptions used to estimate this obligation and may record adjustments prospectively as facts or circumstances change related to the utilized space associated with leased facilities. Purchase CommitmentsAt June 30, 2015, the Company was contractually committed for $226.4 million of capital expenditures for construction materials and purchases of property and equipment.  A majority of these purchase commitments are expected to be satisfied in the next twelve months. These purchase commitments are primarily success based; that is, the Company has executed customer contracts that support the future capital expenditures.Outstanding Letters of CreditAs of June 30, 2015, the Company had $9.2 million in outstanding letters of credit, which were primarily entered into in connection with various lease agreements. ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and carrier disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  (15) RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONSAs discussed in Note 4—Spin-off of Business, the Company spun-off the OVS business to CII on June 13, 2014. CII owns approximately 4% of the Company’s outstanding common stock at June 30, 2015. The Company continues to have ongoing contractual relationships with OVS, whereby the Company provides OVS and its subsidiaries with bandwidth capacity and OVS provides the Company and its subsidiaries with voice services. The contractual relationships are based on agreements that were entered into at estimated market rates. During the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 through the spin-off date of June 13, 2014, transactions with OVS were eliminated upon consolidation. Subsequent to the spin-off date, transactions with OVS are included in the Company’s results of operations. F-36 The following table represents the revenue and expense transactions the Company recorded with OVS (in millions):   Year Ended June 30,   2015  2014  2013 Revenues $6.9  $7.0   6.6 Operating costs $1.0  $1.6   1.5   As of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, the Company had a balance due from OVS in the amount of $0.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively.As discussed in Note 11 – Equity, during Fiscal 2014: i) the Board of CII authorized a non-liquidating distribution to certain common unit holders of up to $10.0 million, and the Company advanced $10.0 million to CII, evidenced by an intercompany note receivable, ii) the board of managers of CII authorized and paid a non-liquidating distribution to the Company’s CEO of $3.0 million and amended the intercompany note receivable with CII for the incremental distribution, and iii) the board of managers of CII authorized and redeemed for cash the vested common units held by a member of management for $9.0 million in full and final settlement of his outstanding common unit grants and further amended the intercompany note receivable with CII for the incremental distribution. The amount due to the Company from CII of $22.0 million was reflected as a reduction of stockholder’s equity as of June 30, 2014.  In October 2014, the Company and CII entered into an agreement which relieved CII of its obligation to repay the outstanding intercompany note receivable balance. As of June 30, 2015, the Company does not have an outstanding receivable balance from CII.Dan Caruso, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board is a party to an aircraft charter (or membership) agreement through his affiliate, Bear Equity LLC, for business and personal travel.  Under the terms of the charter agreement, all fees for the use of the aircraft are effectively variable in nature. For his business travel on behalf of the Company, Mr. Caruso is reimbursed for his use of the aircraft subject to quarterly and annual maximum reimbursement thresholds approved by the Company's Nominating and Governance Committee. During the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the Company reimbursed Mr. Caruso $0.7 million and $0.1 million for his business use of the aircraft.On June 28, 2012, Matt Erickson, the President of Zayo Physical Infrastructure, purchased $0.6 million in aggregate principal amount of ZGL’s 10.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020 at the offering price for such notes. Mr. Erickson qualifies as an “accredited investor” (as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act), and this purchase was on terms available to other investors. On December 15, 2014, in connection with the December Notes Redemption, approximately $0.2 million of Mr. Erickson’s notes were redeemed, and as of June 30, 2015, the principal amount of notes outstanding was $0.4 million.  (16) SEGMENT REPORTINGThe Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer.The Company’s individual strategic product groups (“SPGs”) are organized into three operating segments based on the similarities of business activities: Physical Infrastructure, Cloud and Connectivity and Other. The Company’s operating segments are also its reporting segments. The Physical Infrastructure operating segment is comprised of the following SPGs: Dark Fiber, Mobile Infrastructure, and Zayo Colocation (“zColo”). The Cloud and Connectivity operating segment is comprised of the following SPGs: Wavelengths, Ethernet, IP, SONET and Cloud. SPGs report directly to the segment managers who are responsible for the operations and financial results for the Physical Infrastructure, Cloud and Connectivity and Other reportable segments. The segment managers for each of the Physical Infrastructure, Cloud and Connectivity and Other operating segments report directly to the CODM, and it is the financial results of those segments that are evaluated and drive the resource allocation decisions.F-37 The Company’s three operating segments are described below:Physical Infrastructure. Through the Physical Infrastructure segment, the Company provides raw bandwidth infrastructure to customers that require more control of their internal networks. These services include dark fiber, mobile infrastructure (fiber-to-the-tower and small cell), and colocation and interconnection. Dark fiber is a physically separate and secure, private platform for dedicated bandwidth. The Company leases dark fiber pairs (usually 2 to 12 total fibers) to its customers, who “light” the fiber using their own optronics. The Company’s mobile infrastructure services provide direct fiber connections to cell towers, small cells, hub sites, and mobile switching centers. The Company’s datacenters offer colocation and interconnection services to its customers, who then house and power the Company’s computing and networking equipment for the purpose of aggregating and distributing data, voice, Internet, and video traffic. Physical Infrastructure customers include carriers and other communication service providers, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, major media and content companies, large enterprises, and other companies that have the expertise to run their own fiber optic networks or require interconnected technical space. The contract terms in the Physical Infrastructure segment generally tend to range from three to twenty years. Cloud and Connectivity. The Cloud and Connectivity segment provides bandwidth infrastructure solutions over the Company’s metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks where it uses optronics to light the fiber and the Company’s customers pay for access based on the amount and type of bandwidth they purchase. The Company’s services within this segment include wavelength, Ethernet, IP, SONET, and cloud services with capacity ranging from 1.54Mb to 100G. The Company targets customers who require a minimum of 10G of bandwidth across their networks. Cloud and Connectivity customers include carriers, financial services companies, healthcare, government institutions, education institutions and other enterprises. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years. Other. The Other segment is primarily comprised of ZPS. ZPS provides network and technical resources to customers in designing, acquiring and maintaining their networks. Services are typically provided for a term of one year for a fixed recurring monthly fee in the case of network and on an hourly basis for technical resources (usage revenue). Revenues for all of the Company’s products are included in one of the Company’s three segments. The results of operations for each segment include an allocation of certain indirect costs and corporate related costs, including overhead and third party-financed debt. The allocation is based on a percentage that represents management’s estimate of the relative burden each segment bears of indirect and corporate costs. Management has evaluated the allocation methods utilized to allocate these costs and determined they are systematic and rational. Identifiable assets for each reportable segment are reconciled to total consolidated assets including unallocated corporate assets and intersegment eliminations. Unallocated corporate assets consist primarily of cash and deferred taxes.Segment Adjusted EBITDASegment Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company’s CODM to evaluate segment operating performance.The Company defines Segment Adjusted EBITDA as earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) adjusted to exclude acquisition or disposal-related transaction costs, losses on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation, unrealized foreign currency gains (losses) on intercompany loans, and non-cash income (loss) on equity and cost method investments. The Company uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance, and this financial measure is among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods. The Company believes that the presentation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and facilitates comparison of the Company’s results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures.Segment Adjusted EBITDA results, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are also utilized by the Company and its Compensation Committee for purposes of determining bonus payouts to employees.Segment Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Company’s results from operations and operating cash flows as reported under GAAP. For example, Segment Adjusted EBITDA: •does not reflect capital expenditures, or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments; •does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; •does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service the interest payments, on the Company’s debt; and •does not reflect cash required to pay income taxes.F-38 The Company’s computation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because all companies do not calculate segment Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.   For the year ended June 30, 2015   (in millions)   PhysicalInfrastructure  Cloud andConnectivity  Other  Corp/Eliminations  Total Revenue from external customers $662.4  $661.5  $23.2  $—  $1,347.1 Segment Adjusted EBITDA  432.8   344.5   5.3  —   782.6 Total assets  3,694.4   1,976.0   35.0   389.2   6,094.6 Capital expenditures  328.4   201.8   0.2  —   530.4    For the year ended June 30, 2014   (in millions)   PhysicalInfrastructure  Cloud andConnectivity  Other  Corp/Eliminations  Total Revenue from external customers $495.4  $606.2  $28.1  $(6.5) $1,123.2 Segment Adjusted EBITDA  324.9   325.9   8.0   (5.2)  653.6 Total assets  2,872.5   1,739.1   43.1   327.0   4,981.7 Capital expenditures  209.2   151.6  —  —   360.8    For the year ended June 30, 2013   (in millions)   PhysicalInfrastructure  Cloud andConnectivity  Other  Corp/Eliminations  Total Revenue from external customers $413.0  $570.5  $27.8  $(6.9) $1,004.4 Segment Adjusted EBITDA  275.7   277.8   6.2   (5.3)  554.4 Total assets (1)  2,311.5   1,685.5   32.4   122.7   4,152.1 Capital expenditures, net of stimulus grant reimbursements  180.3   143.0  —  —   323.3 (1)Assets of discontinued operations of $72.1 million are included in the Corp/elimination column for the year ended June 30, 2013 Reconciliation from Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net loss from continuing operations    For the year ended June 30,   2015  2014  2013   (in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $782.6  $653.6  $554.4 Interest expense  (214.0)  (203.5)  (202.5)Depreciation and amortization expense  (406.2)  (338.2)  (324.5)Transaction costs  (6.2)  (5.3)  (14.2)Stock-based compensation  (200.7)  (253.7)  (105.8)Loss on extinguishment of debt  (94.3)  (1.9)  (77.3)Unrealized foreign currency gain/(loss)  (24.4)  4.7   0.1 Non-cash loss on investments  (0.9) —  — Net loss from continuing operations before provision   for income taxes $(164.1) $(144.3) $(169.8)  F-39 The following is a summary of geographical information (in millions):   For the year ended June 30,   2015  2014  2013 Revenue from external customers:            United States $1,193.5  $1,052.8  $946.5 United Kingdom  119.0   70.3   57.5 Japan                              —   0.1   0.4 France  34.6  —  — Total Revenue $1,347.1  $1,123.2  $1,004.4 Long-lived assets:            United States $3,848.0  $3,142.4   2,995.3 United Kingdom  405.3   429.9   120.2 Japan  0.3   0.3   — France  48.7   —   — Total Long-lived assets $4,302.3  $3,572.6  $3,115.5  The Company includes all non-current assets, except for goodwill and assets of discontinued operations, in its long-lived assets. On July 2, 2014, the Company acquired Neo. The Company reported the operating results of Neo in the “Other Segment” in its previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q during Fiscal 2015. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the Company implemented certain changes to its SPG structure which resulted in the operating results and assets of the acquired Neo entity to be further distributed amongst the Physical Infrastructure and Cloud and Connectivity reporting segments.

The Fine Print: The following comments are owned by whoever posted them.  We are not responsible for them in any way.
however, the big issue is the connection to our old friend, The Connected Internet. if you don't live next to a peering point, you are going to have to backhaul to it, or hook to another Tier 1 or 2 provider who is.  money, money, money.  lighting the glass is not free, either.pipe dream.300â per month for gigabit port in some peering points. Of course you still need to peer with other networks and you will need transit (at least until you reach tier-1 status ;) ) but competition at most exchanges is much bigger for transit so you can get an ok deal. Fiber backhaul is very expensive if you need to lease private dark fiber (but around here you also have some that is publicly owned and cheaper), microwave links do not need to be, depending on the situation. Roof access at the datacenter Also, unless there are massive advances in satellite internet (which there very well could be), the reliance upon massive corporations who own backbones will always be there holding us back.We need advanced technology to free us but the problem is that R&D projects are always going to be hamstrung by lobbyists and big corps.The other big issue here is student debt, tbh. Take any PHD and unless they sell their soul to big corps, they are penniless. It reminds me of guys like Tesla, who despite all of his advancements for human technology, died alone and completely depressed and broke.If we could eradicate reliance upon educational institutions for furthering human knowledge, we could then start seeing more and more open source solutions to big problems.AI is going to somewhat solve this problem. The AI arms race will be all about computing power. As quantum computers advance and become more accessible, an average person will eventually be able to do way more than they could today, including research and also personal protection, on the same level as large corporations or governments. But even then, we have the problem that everything we use for computing is sourced by massive corporations. Sure, eventually 3d printing will make home computer construction a possibility, but that's a long ways away.If the world starts embracing a fair universal income standard, we could also see huge advancements happening from basements and garages at a much higher rate than today but still these efforts will face roadblocks designed by massive companies like MSFT and Apple who prefer to keep us in the dark about most of their design and getting worse every day for selfishness.Today? Students are caught within the politics of old boys networks. That also is a huge obstacle. That said, most of these kinds of problems could potentially change dramatically as we further deplete our natural resources and our governments continue to be terrible examples of human beings.But if you look at Health Care, for example, in many countries where a proper health care standard exists where people aren't bankrupted by hospital bills, that is always a public service and never is there a case supporting 3rd party health care where citizens are better off short term or long term.I guess if there was a state security element to health care, we might see worse results with a public health care system, but overall the private healthcare systems are just terribly corrupt.The average person today has way more computing power in their cell phone than any government or corporation several decades ago - it hasn't changed the balance of power because governments and corporations *also*  have radically increased their computing power, so it still dwarfs that controlled by individuals.  AI capable of solving endemic social problems is unlikely to help much, because the people profiting from those problems will have their own, far more powerful AIs dedicated to improving their profits.  The result being that not only would the profiteers be more powerful than the disordered masses, as they are today, they'd also have radically more powerful intelligence at their disposal than the masses.The average person today has way more computing power in their cell phone than any government or corporation several decades ago - it hasn't changed the balance of power because governments and corporations *also* have radically increased their computing power, so it still dwarfs that controlled by individuals.You're right. However, my more nuanced point that possibly wasn't explained well enough is that we need to start actively thwarting that stranglehold. Individualism is good to a point. Collectivism is Is Tesla doing anything to fight corruption?  I must have missed that press release.  They're doing an end-run around corrupt regulations in order to do business, maybe even fighting those specific regulations that interfere with their profits, but that's hardly the same thing as ""good"".But if you look at Health Care, for example, in many countries where a proper health care standard exists where people aren't bankrupted by hospital bills, that is always a public service and never is there a case supporting 3rd party health care where citizens are better off short term or long term.Are you under the impression that there is no 3rd-party private healthcare option in places where there is a national health service, like in Canada or the UK? You may want to take another look at the situation... Bespoke healthcare is fairly common in the UK, and countless Canadians cross the border into the US for their medical needs.But if you look at Health Care, for example, in many countries where a proper health care standard exists where people aren't bankrupted by hospital bills, that is always a public service and never is there a case supporting 3rd party health care where citizens are better off short term or long term.Are you under the impression that there is no 3rd-party private healthcare option in places where there is a national health service, like in Canada or the UK?

So, no.  Not a replacement for logic.  More like a slaver of.""Massive advances in satellite internet""Yes, all you need to do is repeal the laws of physics.  Simple.Indeed.

If there's a publicly available fiber backbone, I'm not aware of it.Call me a cynic, but I think there are other flaws as well.For one thing, it seems fairly obvious to me that moving from a national+state-government-regulated Internet to a local-government-regulated Internet is just creating many opportunities for problems where before we had, nominally, ""only"" 51.And that's not to say that the feds, and the states, wouldn't step in and regulate from afar either; after all, There's a the flaw in this plan.

They'll likely pass rules to prevent any such 'people's internet revolution(TM)'.No, the only way I see for taking back control is to either remove government regulation of the internet or to reduce the size, power, and scope of the government overall.As long as Big Government and it's inherent corruption and cronyism controls it, it will not be operated in the best There's a the flaw in this plan.

I'm gonna go build my own internet infrastructure, with blackjack and hookers.In fact, forget the internet thing!I believe the subject of the article was written as a bet to see how long it would take for the first reference about blackjack and hookers to be posted.I hear they have those those things on the internet now.Me too. I'm a bit sad to see it took four first-level posts to get to it.I'd be interested to see how these ""communities"" manage to afford to lay their own billion dollar T1 backbone infrastructure. Good luck rattling the tin for the funds for that! You might as well say people who are fed up with traffic laws should built their own highways - a dose of realism is needed here people. Infrastructure is NOT cheap.But it's getting cheaper, and that's the point.We're entering an era where reliable, unlicensed frequency gigabit radios are small thousands to buy and install. Buried fibre may still be the most reliable option, but for residential and SOHO internet this is generally ""good enough"" and easily comparable to uptimes for Cable/DSL/GPON. That puts cost recovery on a small investment + monthly internet within 2 years for most projects.
Those uptimes will depend on range and weather. I'd parallel in a lower frequency/bandwidth backup.This reminds me a lot about what we're currently seeing happening with the Rust programming language. It's following a very similar path, and I think the outcome could be the same in the end.So there's the incumbent. In the case of Rust, the incumbent is C++. It has been entrenched for decades, and has become very successful.Then we have these Rust upstarts come along, who want to do things their own way. It's not necessarily the case that they can do any better; they're more interested in just being differ They could just use leased lines, VPN tunnels, and wifi.   You build some free network in one downtown community with boring free public-access quality content.  It costs nothing to run that, then you link a few of these community hotspots together with VPN and suddenly you have a network.   Cost of putting content on the network?  Maybe very low, there are lots of peer to peer technologies that could develop into free CDN like services.  Maybe you connect and the captive portal offers up some browser plugi The technology available to ordinary people is not long-range. You get a hundred meters with regular APs, and a few kilometers line-of-sight wireless with directional antennas - but you can't go around stringing fiber up all over a city, or burying it alongside roads.I'd love to try what you are doing. Seriously, I would. It sounds like a fun challenge and a satisfying project. But for that to be viable I'd need a very high density of local nerds with the inclination and ability to join me. Very few places Hahah I'm not even trying to do it sadly but I did spend a little bit of time daydreaming about the feasibility and details since making that post.I was one of the first users on TOR and a relatively early internet adopter so I know what infant networks look like compared to what they look like once they're in the mainstream.All we would need to do is configure one of those dual SSID wifi networks with an open guest side, prioritize the AP owner's private side over the open guest side.  Have it connect to t First thing, forget Freenet. Nice idea, great at what it does, but not what we want - that extreme level of counter-monitoring has a serious performance hit. Also it's storage architecture is seriously inelegant, and that's not fixable - it makes block management unweildy. I suggest IPFS instead. If you want to do what you propose, IPFS may be the key to viability.AP + captive portal with instructions + IPFS node with generous cache tied across the internet. That'll get you everything except real-time commu Wow that IPFS is exactly the sort of problem we would need to solve eventually,  But just getting a wan set up and exposed to small parts of the world over wifi would be step one.  As I said you can't do that forever but you could surely run like that until you'd attracted nerd talent and tech resources to move to the next phase.But for that to be viable I'd need a very high density of local nerds with the inclination and ability to join me.

The concern here is that the Government is removing regulation that keeps the monopolistic communication companies from ruining the internet. The regulation was good and worked to keep the internet healthy. The problem here isn't government control, it is corporate lackeys placed into influential government positions specifically to remove regulatory hurdles for the corporations.And, I'd note that the government intervention was only needed because of the greed of the big ISPs. Before Net Neutrality was a government regulation, it was the unwritten law of the land. If you ran an ISP, you treated two video packets the same regardless if one came from Netflix and the other came from some tiny, obscure site.Then, the big ISPs saw the Internet companies making a ton of money and got greedy. They wanted some of that and decided to get it, not by innovating, but by charging on both ends. I don't see how bottom up is far too expensive or complicated for large national corporations (with deep pockets) but is going to help some small grassroots effort to build another internet.  As far as I can tell, the large companies can keep the local municipalities in line by threatening not to move into the area.The difference is bottom up local government, where comcast and others have to subvert thousands of municipalitiesRight, because there's no way a Comcast or Verizon could subvert thousands of municipalities.You understand that before you were likely born Verizon, Comcast, and dozens of other cable companies and telcos got their local monopolies willingly given to them by ""thousands of municipalities""...The difference is bottom up local government, where comcast and others have to subvert thousands of municipalitiesRight, because there's no way a Comcast or Verizon could subvert thousands of municipalities.You understand that before you were likely born Verizon, Comcast, and dozens of other cable companies and telcos got their local monopolies willingly given to them by ""thousands of municipalities""...we must end our reliance on big telecom monopolies and build decentralized, affordable, locally owned internet infrastructure.

These days, we're actually discussing 2015's FCC Title II rules.  See  : https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_pub... [fcc.gov] Part of Micheal Orielly's dissent to this (he's an Obama appointee for anyone thinking this is a Trump thing), the part relevant to framing our understanding of old vs new Net Neutrality, is as follows (see page 399) :The FCC ""fact"" sheet promised bright line rules, but the reality is that the bulk of this rulemakingwill be conducted through case-by-case adjudication, mostly at the Bureau level and in the courts. To besure, there are three bright line rules: no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization. But those aremere needles in a Title II haystack.Essentially, Title II is too vast, to burdensome and basically serves as a stiffling mechanism to Internet growth, whilThe FCC ""fact"" sheet promised bright line rules, but the reality is that the bulk of this rulemakingwill be conducted through case-by-case adjudication, mostly at the Bureau level and in the courts.

You telling me that 2 years isn't long enough for the internet to change?  Remember when bit torrent wasn't a thing?  So do I.  Heck I even remember when ISPs began having fits because quake was taking up huge chunks of their local bandwidth.  Had traffic shaping tech been available back then, I am pretty sure they would have been turning off apps left and right.  It's only fairly recently that networks have started seriously shaping and limiting their bandwidth.You call me bad nerd and then say we didn't have traffic shaping circa the Quake era ?I was working at a ISP circa 1998-2002.  We did have traffic shaping tech back then.  We did use it.  It did screw our users.  We stopped because it was screwing our users and wasn't in the best interest of the company and basically hurt the service and thus our corporate image.Maybe you're just not old enough to remember this stuff ?  The point is not that the FCC Title II rules are from 2015, it's that they are way too c I really curious what appliance you were using way back in 1998, when most of the RFCs for traffic shaping were just coming out?  I myself worked for 2 isps, one Dial-up based from 98 to 2000, with about 30,000 subscribers, and then another from 2000 to 2005 (250,000 adsl subscribers at the end of my stint) and while it is possible we were just some backwoods ISP, I don't remember shaping appliances being a real option until at LEAST 2003.  Sure, you could throttle the connection, but there was nothing near I'm saying *SIMPLER* rules, as pointed out by Micheal Orielly in his dissent to Title II, would be serve the users, and actually be what we've been asking for since day 1.Title II was an abomination of government overreach and bureaucracy gone wrong.Internet 2 has existed for 20 years or so but it's only available to government and universities.Internet 3 needs to be a independent mesh network with zero dependency on government or corporations in order to prevent any of them from getting control.it needs to have no dependency on DNS, DHCP or any registration service which means IPv6 or some other protocol.Start by hosting your own stuff, and running a cable to your neighbors, or by using a radio router or laser router or packet radio to network all ove It's electing people who are committed to CITIZEN'S INTERESTS to Congress.  They can actively appoint qualified, and public-interest-minded heads of departments, like the FCC.During Obama's presidency, we had Tom Wheeler, who ruled (almost universally) in favor of citizens' interests...and, in fact, established the ""Net Neutrality"" rules in 2015...against the wishes of one of his Commission members, Ajit Pai.  When Wheeler retired, Ajit Pai (who is a legal shill who worked at Verizon, who benefits from his decisions) ascended to the Chairman post, and started dismantling the good work done by Mr. Wheeler...mostly (I posit) because he wants that job back at Verizon, when he is replaced in the future.The Republicans are notoriously favorable to providing more advantages to large corporations (e.g., Verizon) and couldn't care less about you and me.  With the Buffoon in the White House, and a Republican dominated Congress, we can expect virtually every government-sponsored benefit to citizens to be abolished or diminished.So, to my mind the ONLY ONE SOLUTION is to restore our government to attending to benefits for citizens...it's not going to be done by a party that passes legislation to give Fat Cats tax breaks, and make you and I pay MORE taxes to cover the giveaway.  Have YOU figured out the solution yet?  It's a plain as the nose on your face!  Make sure that we elect people who CARE about the citizens' interests, not just lining their own pockets.  They will do the work of replacing the people who are engaged in wholesale destruction of every potential good for citizens.  I reason that there is NO REASON our country should be favoring large businesses over individual citizens.  Others' may believe differently.You change the background of you Facebook photo. That is how we prostest now.
Net neutrality might be won back with Blue Team temporarily, but only because it benefits the position of two of the largest internet platforms that are fancying themselves as arbiters of acceptable political speech and news for the masses. Anything good for the public will come as an unintentional byproduct of serving their own interests.

It's rinse and repeat in an endless cycle where one side that fucks us over to the point where voters get pissed and toss them out in favor of the other side that fucks Before going directly for the last-resort option, maybe try to keep that no-good Verizon goon from rolling back net neutrality? I think the mother of all protests is in order. Think SOPA blackout protest times a hundred. Give that a try and see how it goes.I've said this multiple times on slashdot, but in my experience, the best option is to resolve this issue at the County/PUD level. My favourite example is what is available in Chelan and Douglas counties, in Eastern Washington state. In both of these counties, the PUDs have built out nearly ubiquitous FTTH networks.The trick is that the PUDs only provide the last mile service, they don't provide the content (in the case of TV) or Internet service. When a local resident wants to sign up, they have the choice of some 8 or 9 ISPs, and 6+ TV providers, all of whom in turn transport that service over the County network. Businesses can also buy transport from Zayo, Cogent, and some other peering provider. For the resident, it's easy... Their bill for TV or Internet (or both), has something like a $6/mo line access charge which covers the fiber connection, and the rest is for service. On the flip side, the service provider doesn't need to maintain the last mile.The PUDs themselves are responsible to their residents through elections, and from my observation are very responsive to faults in their systems. I was involved in the summer of 2015 when a wildfire burned through and knocked out a significant chunk of their infrastructure, both power and fiber. They had the fiber truck rolling right behind the power trucks, and had the system back up and running as soon as they could source and plant 50+ replacement power poles.This kind of thing really does work.I've said this multiple times on slashdot, but in my experience, the best option is to resolve this issue at the County/PUD leveThey know [slashdot.org]. Somebody was listening to you.What a fantastic idea! All he is proposing is entering a regulated business (becoming your own ""Internet Service Provider""), and simply ignoring the existing regulations! It's amazing how many brilliant ideas these Internet Wunder-kind come up with that have as a basic part of their business plan the simple disregard/ignoring of any applicable regulation.So the plan is to exploit a non-existent ""public backbone"", erect your own wireless towers and maybe even lay cable along the right-of-way? I can't imagine I didn't say ""no technical solution"", my issue was the existing regulations that he just decided don't apply, freeing this ""new"" internet from the legal shackles of regulations.The linked-to article is talking about paralleling the existing physical plant owned by big ISPs with an alternate plant constructed of the same/similar technology owned by municipalities.I don't understand how it is that a Comcast or Verizon-like company, classified as an ISP is subject to federal regulation, but somehow when your t Trump voters did this. And worse.Please, rethink your politics. This is just the beginning of the train wreck.So the FCC, up until a couple years ago had no ""net neutrality"" regulations, then they implemented some regulations, that the FCC is now considering rolling those ""net neutrality"" regulations back, and the best answer it to create your own unregulated internet as an alternative to the soon-to-be unregulated internet?In cities where the density of privately owned computers is high enough, it would be technically feasible to use mesh networks for most of the local traffic. You scratch my back, I forward your packets and provide local caching services for viral content. Something along those lines. Still need some gateways to long-distance networks, but most of the infrastructure doesn't need to be owned by giant cancerous corporations. Let's not forget soulless and driven by nothing but profit maximization. (Ranting now, You'd also need to use some sort of content addressed distributed store to make bulk traffic manageable. I see some potential in IPFS. If you take the distributed store from that, and combine it with mesh networking, then... well, it's still not entirely workable. But it's an avenue to explore.I feel like I failed to be sufficiently clear, though I think I agree with your comment. Technology remains morally neutral. Technology can be used to increase freedom or destroy it. Highly centralized networks of the corporations, with rules by the lawyers, for the greater wealth of the richest 0.1% are NOT going to increase your (or my) freedom.

Much better than uniformly.  The problem is your latency becomes abysmal as your number of nodes increases.  In a circular city of 200,000 you will have 80 to 250 hops to transit that city.  Using cheap CPU based routing you will introduce seconds of latency.  You won't care if you are watching a movie and have a decent buffer, but Skype will be very clunky, game play impossible.One way to lessen the latency is have several different gateways out to the internet at large. Maybe if you had 1 dedicated gateway for each class C network, it might help.With proper power management and a butterfly network type of design, bandwidth can increase with the ln of the number of nodes.

It looks like Big Telecom is going to get its way and we will be paying even more and getting substantially less. Soon we'll have to pay a base price of around 50.00. Then add 5.00 extra for streaming, 5.00 extra for HD streaming, 5.00 for social network access, and so on and so forth.With the abundance of commodity hardware, open source software, and the relative ease of wireless deployments, it is easier to do > Then add 5.00 extra for streaming, 5.00 extra for HD streaming, 5.00 for social network access, and so on and so forth.Actually, tiered pricing based on QoS and bandwidth would be fine (assuming reasonable competition in the ISP market).

Peers connect to the Internet via ISP, which are part of a collection of star networks.  Peers act as hosts or ""service"" providers when they make connections to several hundred peers and host a copy of their websites on a local HD.  Many ISP's ToS forbid such activity.  Some ISP's block P2P connections, considering them to be torrents used for illegal activity.A tru Some of those - Freenet and IPFS at least, I don't know enough about the others to say - are capable of operating in an almost fully distributed manner using only short-range wifi mesh.

"""SearchLike many of you reading this blog, I have been using the service Free ConferenceCall.com for many years. I got an email from them last week warning that their service will likely go dark, and they wanted users of the service to call Congress to help keep them in business.Their issue stems back to an FCC order issued in September of last year that seeks to stop the practice of access arbitrage. This FCC summary of the order describes the situation well. Some small telcos have been making money by billing access on ‘free’ minutes generated by services like free conference calling. The process of making money from free calling services has been known in the industry as access arbitrage.The FCC tried to stop access arbitrage in 2011. At that time, small rural telcos billed a rate of as much as a penny or two per minute to originate or terminate a long-distance call. Some telcos that were allowed to bill the high rates were making a lot of money by originating calls for free outgoing call center services or by terminating calls from 800 numbers, conference calling services, or free chat lines.In the 2011 order, the FCC eliminated the access fees associated with terminating a call, migrating to what the FCC called ‘bill and keep’, and they hoped that eliminating the access revenues would kill the arbitrage practices. The FCC order was largely effective and chat lines and other free arbitrage services quickly disappeared.However, the 2011 order didn’t kill all access charges, and over time the folks who make money with arbitrage found another way to make money with free calling. One of the few access charges left untouched in 2011 was transport, which compensates telcos for the use of fiber networks connecting telcos to the outside world. I’ve noticed that the caller ID for FreeConferenceCalling.com numbers is mostly from Iowa and South Dakota, and I have to assume those calls are being terminated at switches that are remote and that can still bill significant miles of transport.The access fees billed to terminate calls are paid by the carrier that originates the call. This means that most remaining terminating access is paid today by long-distance carriers like AT&T, Sprint and CenturyLink, which together still sell the bulk of long-distance telephone services. The dollar magnitude of access arbitrage is much smaller than a decade ago. The FCC estimates arbitrage is currently a $40 – $60 million problem, whereas it was hundreds of millions before the FCC’s 2011 order. But those fees are being billed to the long-distance companies that get no benefit from the transaction (thus the term arbitrage – the companies are billing the fees because the rules allow a loophole to do so).FreeConferenceCalling.com is not the only company doing this, and it’s likely that many conference calling services rely wholly or partially on the arbitrage. It’s worth noting that conference call services that use the Internet to place calls will not be affected by this change – because those calls don’t invoke access charges. The carriers billing for the access on the conference calling may or may not be sharing the revenues with companies like FreeConferenceCalling.com – in either case those carriers no longer have any financial reason to continue the practice.Companies like FreeConferenceCalling.com don’t automatically have to go out of business, but the FCC order means a drastic change to the way they do business. For instance, the company could start charging a monthly fee for conference calling – likely forcing this particular company to change its name. They might sell advertisements for those sitting waiting for a conference call. They could charge for services like recording calls.It’s more likely that companies like FreeConferenceCalling.com will quietly die or fade away. I tried using the service yesterday and it already seems to be broken. This latest FCC order probably puts the final nail into the coffin of access arbitrage – although I’ve learned to never say never. As long as there are any fees for calling based upon regulatory orders, there is a chance that somebody will find a way to generate lots of calls that fit the circumstance and get enriched by the arbitrage.Bloomberg reported that CenturyLink and Alphabet are interested in buying Zayo. It’s been anticipated that Zayo would be the next fiber acquisition target since the Level 3 merger with CenturyLink since they are the largest remaining independent owner of fiber.As you might expect, the biggest owners of fiber are the big telcos and cable companies. Consider the miles of fiber owned by the ten biggest fiber owners – I note these miles of fiber are from the end of 2017 and a few of these companies like Verizon have been building a lot of fiber since then.You might wonder why this matters? First, Zayo is the largest company on the list who’s only business is to sell transport. All of Zayo’s fiber is revenue producing. While the companies above it on the list have a lot more fiber, a lot of that fiber is in the last mile in neighborhoods where there is not a lot of opportunity to sell access to others. The biggest independent fiber owner used to be Level 3, with 200,000 miles of revenue-producing fiber before they merged with CenturyLink.The numbers on this chart don’t tell the whole story. Companies like Zayo also swap fiber with other networks. They may trade a pair of fibers on a route they own for a route elsewhere that they want to reach. These swapping arrangements mean the transport providers like Zayo, Cogent and Level 3 control a lot more fiber than is indicated by these numbers.It matters because as soon as you get outside of the metropolitan areas there are not many options for fiber transport. A few years ago I helped a City look for fiber transport and the three options they found that were reasonably priced were CenturyLink, Level 3 and Zayo. If CenturyLink buys Zayo they will have purchased both competitors in this region and will effectively eliminated fiber transport competition for this community. Without that competition it’s inevitable that transport prices will rise.I think back to the early days of competition after the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I remember working with clients in the 1990s looking for fiber transport, and there were many cases where there was only one provider willing to sell transport to a community. If the sole provider was the local telco or cable company it was likely that the cost of transport was four or five times more expensive than prices in nearby communities with more choices. When I worked with rural providers in the early 2000s, one of the first question I always asked was about the availability of  transport – because lack of transport sometimes killed business plans.Since then there has been a lot of rural fiber built by companies like statewide fiber networks and others who saw a market for rural transport. Much of the rural construction was egged on by the need to get to cellular towers.My fear is that we’ll slide back to the bad-old-days when rural fiber was a roadblock for providing broadband. I don’t so much fear for the most rural places because those fiber networks are owned by smaller companies and they aren’t going away. I fear more for places like county seats. I worked with a city in Pennsylvania a few years ago where there was a decent number of competitors for transport – Verizon, Zayo, Level 3 and XO. Since then Verizon bought XO and CenturyLink might own the other two. That city is not going to lose transport options, but the reduction from four providers to two giant ones almost surely means higher transport costs over time.I am intrigued that Alphabet (the parent of Google Fiber) would look at buying an extensive fiber network like Zayo. Google is one of the biggest users of bandwidth in the country due to the web traffic to Google and YouTube. Their desire for fiber might be as simple as wanting to control the fiber supply chain they use. If so, that’s almost as disconcerting as CenturyLink buying Zayo if Google wouldn’t remain as a fierce transport competitor.Today’s blog is more about Comcast’s data caps. I recently saw a quote from Brian Roberts, the Comcast CEO during an interview by Business Insider. When asked about the data cap trials he said the following:We don’t want anybody to ever not want to stay connected on our network, but just as with every other thing in your life, if you drive 100,000 miles or 1,000 miles, you buy more gasoline. If you turn on the air conditioning to 60 vs. 72, you consume more electricity. The same is true for usage, so I think the same for a wireless device. The more bits you use, the more you pay.He is basically saying that it costs Comcast more to buy Internet bandwidth for customers who use more bandwidth. Certainly his first example means that – you certainly must buy more gas to drive a vehicle more miles. Is this a good analogy? For it to be true Comcast would have to be buying raw bandwidth each time a customer uses the Internet – this would mean when you download something at your house that Comcast is somehow buying more bandwidth from the big Internet spigot.But that’s not how it works. While Comcast is really big, they are not one of the companies that owns the Internet, so they must buy bandwidth just like any other ISP. So how do ISPs buy Internet access? They buy it with two cost components – transport and raw bandwidth. Transport is the cost of getting the bandwidth from one of the major Internet POPs to a market. At Comcast’s size they either have a direct physical presence at each major Internet POP or they have an arrangement with some carrier who does. Due to their sheer size, I have to imagine that Comcast’s cost for transport on a per-megabit basis is lower than anybody else in the industry other than maybe AT&T, who is one of the owners of the Internet structure.Transport can be a major cost for an ISP that operates a long distance from a major POP. I have small ISP clients that spend between $10,000 and $20,000 per month on transport, which is a lot if you only have a few thousand customers. But for Comcast this cost has to be miniscule on a per customer basis. And the cost is fixed. Once you buy transport to a market it doesn’t matter how much bandwidth you shove through the pipe. So this cost doesn’t increase due to customer usage.The other cost is to buy the actual Internet connectivity — an expense that is sometimes referred to as an Internet port. This is an electronic connection directly into the main Internet routers. My small clients pay anywhere from $1 to $5 per raw dedicated megabit per month for Internet bandwidth. Generally the more you buy the cheaper it gets. Again, one has to imagine that Comcast pays a lot less than my clients due to their huge size.And even that cost can be significantly reduced by large ISPs like Comcast through peering. Peering is where a carrier like Comcast makes a direct connection to companies with a lot of Internet usage like Netflix or Google. From an economic standpoint, peering is essentially the sam as transport and bypasses paying for the Internet port. Any traffic that goes through the peering connection does not increase with a customer’s use of the bandwidth.An ISP’s total cost for an Internet port is based upon the average of the busiest times of the month. For instance, a small ISP might use 500 raw megabits of aggregate usage on most evenings, but if their customers have a few nights per month where they use 700 megabits, then the ISP pays for that larger amount for the whole month.The interesting thing about this pricing structure is that the ISP pays the same every day of the month whether the customers are using the data or not. The cost to Comcast wouldn’t change if any one customer, or even all of the customers in a city, were to use more data, as long as that usage doesn’t create a new fastest day of the month. From a cost accounting basis, this means that the cost of Internet bandwidth can also be considered as a fixed cost. There is nothing that any one customer, or even a fairly large pile of customers, can do to change the cost of the bandwidth to Comcast. It does not cost them more when you watch an extra movie.The idea that Comcast is paying more for somebody who downloads 500 gigabits per month than somebody who uses half of that is false. If that 500 gigabit customer was to instead use zero bandwidth in a given month then Comcast’s costs wouldn’t change by a penny.To put this into a different perspective, many of my clients have done the math and in aggregate their bandwidth costs them between $2 and $5 per customer per month depending upon how small they are. This is the average of transport costs, any peering costs and the Internet port costs. I would be surprised if a large ISP like Comcast is spending much more than $1 to $2 per customer per month for bandwidth. For them to charge $35 for going over their data cap is outrageous and that charge is 100% profit to them.Roberts did make one true analogy when he compared his data caps to wireless carriers like Verizon and AT&T. They buy bandwidth in the same way that Comcast does, and so it also doesn’t cost them extra when a customer uses an additional gigabit on their cellphone. US wireless data is very close to the most expensive bandwidth in the world and you have to go to places like Africa to see bandwidth being sold for as high pf a price. The cable companies like Comcast have eyed the Verizon and AT&T wireless profits with envy and the data caps are nothing more than an attempt to greatly bump up what they can bill for data. They will be billing customers for going above an arbitrary cap, while in reality using more bandwidth doesn’t cost Comcast anything extra.Today Mozilla filed comments with the FCC with a clever solution that would fix the net neutrality fiasco. Attached is the Mozilla filing. I call the solution clever, because if the FCC wants to solve net neutrality Mozilla has shown them a path to do so.Mozilla has asked to split Internet traffic into two parts. First is the traffic between ISPs and end-user customers. Mozilla is suggesting that this part of the business can remain under the current regulatory rules. The second portion is the traffic between ISPs like Comcast and AT&T and content providers like Facebook, NetFlix, etc. Mozilla recommends that the FCC reclassify this as transport under Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.The current dilemma we are facing with net neutrality is that FCC lacked the courage to classify the Internet network as common carrier business. Instead, in 2002, when broadband was growing explosively, the FCC classified all Internet traffic as an information service. And that decision is why we are even having the debate today about net neutrality. If the FCC had originally decided to regulate the Internet then it would have full authority to enforce the net neutrality rules it passed a few years ago.But even in 2002 the FCC was a bit cowed by the political pressure put on them by lobbyists. The argument at the time was that the FCC needed to keep hands off the burgeoning Internet so as to not restrict its growth. It’s hard for me to see how classifying the Internet business as common carrier business would have changed the growth of the Internet and I believe it all boiled down to the fact that the cable companies did not want to be further regulated by the FCC.The net neutrality rules written a few years ago by the FCC basically say that ISPs have an obligation to deliver all packets on the Internet without discrimination. Mozilla is suggesting that there is an additional legal obligation between ISPs and content providers to deliver their traffic without discrimination.This argument might seem a bit obscure to somebody not in the industry, but it removes the dilemma of not being able to regulate the traffic between ISPs and content providers. The suggested change is to not classify data packets at the carrier level as information services, but to recognize it by its normal network function – that is the transporting of data from one place to another. Today transport is regulated in the sense that if a carrier sells a data pipe of a certain amount of bandwidth to another carrier they are obligated to deliver the bandwidth they have charged for. By putting the gigantic data pipes that extend between companies like NetFlix and Comcast under the transport regime it would treat Internet traffic like any other data pipe.This change makes a lot of sense from a network perspective. After all, it’s hard to think of the transaction where NetFlix hands a huge data pipe to Comcast or AT&T as an information service. Comcast is doing no more than taking the data on that pipe and moving that data where it is supposed to go. That is the pure definition of transport. It only becomes an information service on the last mile of the network where the data traffic is handed off to end-user customers. There are already millions of other data circuits today that are regulated under the transport rules. It make logical sense to say that a 10 gigabit Internet circuit is basically the same, at the carrier level, as a 10 gigabit circuit carrying voice or corporate data. Data pipes are data pipes. We don’t peer into other data pipes to see what kind of traffic they are carrying. But by classifying the Internet as an information services that is exactly what we do with those circuits.This idea gives the FCC an out if they really want net neutrality to work. I personally think that Chairman Wheeler is thrilled to death to see net neutrality being picked apart since he spent years lobbying against it before taking the job. So I am going to guess that the Mozilla suggestion will be ignored and ISPs will be allowed to discriminate among carriers, for pay. I hope he proves me wrong, but if he ignores this suggestion then we know he was only paying lip service to net neutrality.Enter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.

"""SearchBloomberg reported that CenturyLink and Alphabet are interested in buying Zayo. It’s been anticipated that Zayo would be the next fiber acquisition target since the Level 3 merger with CenturyLink since they are the largest remaining independent owner of fiber.As you might expect, the biggest owners of fiber are the big telcos and cable companies. Consider the miles of fiber owned by the ten biggest fiber owners – I note these miles of fiber are from the end of 2017 and a few of these companies like Verizon have been building a lot of fiber since then.You might wonder why this matters? First, Zayo is the largest company on the list who’s only business is to sell transport. All of Zayo’s fiber is revenue producing. While the companies above it on the list have a lot more fiber, a lot of that fiber is in the last mile in neighborhoods where there is not a lot of opportunity to sell access to others. The biggest independent fiber owner used to be Level 3, with 200,000 miles of revenue-producing fiber before they merged with CenturyLink.The numbers on this chart don’t tell the whole story. Companies like Zayo also swap fiber with other networks. They may trade a pair of fibers on a route they own for a route elsewhere that they want to reach. These swapping arrangements mean the transport providers like Zayo, Cogent and Level 3 control a lot more fiber than is indicated by these numbers.It matters because as soon as you get outside of the metropolitan areas there are not many options for fiber transport. A few years ago I helped a City look for fiber transport and the three options they found that were reasonably priced were CenturyLink, Level 3 and Zayo. If CenturyLink buys Zayo they will have purchased both competitors in this region and will effectively eliminated fiber transport competition for this community. Without that competition it’s inevitable that transport prices will rise.I think back to the early days of competition after the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I remember working with clients in the 1990s looking for fiber transport, and there were many cases where there was only one provider willing to sell transport to a community. If the sole provider was the local telco or cable company it was likely that the cost of transport was four or five times more expensive than prices in nearby communities with more choices.

"""An award-winning team of journalists, designers, and videographers who tell brand stories through Fast Company's distinctive lensWhat’s next for hardware, software, and servicesOur annual guide to the businesses that matter the mostLeaders who are shaping the future of business in creative waysNew workplaces, new food sources, new medicine--even an entirely new economic systemCelebrating the best ideas in businessIf there’s one explanation for the dysfunctional state of home internet service in the U.S., it’s a lack of competition. With only one or two options for high-speed broadband in most places–or no options in rural areas–consumers have little ability to escape routine price hikes, data caps, overage charges, the erosion of net neutrality, and weak privacy protections.That’s why the birth of wireless home internet has been so frustrating to observe. While major telcos like Verizon and T-Mobile make grand proclamations about disrupting home broadband with speedy 5G wireless internet service, the reality on the ground–or, rather, in the air–is harsher. Even with low buildout costs and limitless consumer demand, building out the wireless home internet of the future is a painstakingly methodical endeavor.For proof, just look to startups like Starry and Common Networks, which for the past couple years have been building the kind of wireless home internet service that the telco giants now want to offer. Both startups are well-funded–Starry raised a $100 million Series C round in July, and Common Networks followed with a $25 million Series B round last month–yet their rollouts are slow-going. Starry hopes to be in 16 markets by year-end, nearly three years after launch, and Common Networks is shooting for five total markets by the end of 2019.Starry Station [Photo: courtesy of Starry]The excruciating pace could partly be attributed to wireless technology, which is still evolving and could use more spectrum to operate in, but the bigger factor is more boring: Setting up any kind of internet service in a new city–whether it involves underground cables or airwaves–is just an arduous process.“At the end of the day, this is building infrastructure, even though we’re building it in this new novel way, where we don’t have to dig up streets and we don’t have to get up on poles,” says Jessica Shalek, Common Networks’ COO. “Like any technology company that has market-by-market components, that’s real work, and that definitely takes some time.”Wireless home internet has been around for a couple of decades, mainly in rural communities, but Starry and Common Networks are putting a new spin on the idea for urban and suburban markets. Instead of relying on cellular connections, they set up a network of base stations that communicate through higher-frequency spectrum, similar to what Wi-Fi routers use. While the range of these base stations is much shorter, the connections are much faster. Common Networks, for instance, offers download and upload speeds of 75 Mbps for $50 per month, and is working on upgrades to 500 Mbps service now.The base stations then link up to larger wired connection providers, which help feed into the internet backbone. Shalek says most cities and towns have a high-speed fiber connection of this nature, but until now, new internet providers haven’t been able to tap into those connections without digging up neighborhoods and running cable into everyone’s homes at great expense.Common Networks’ CEO cofounder, Zach Brock, says getting access to those fiber networks is relatively straightforward. “If you talk to [fiber providers] Zayo, Level 3, Cogent, Hurricane Electric, Fastmetrics, even AT&T Enterprise–they’re really competitive offerings, and they actually have to work for your patronage, which is nice. And basically every town, every city, has fiber running down Main Street.”Common Networks street graph [Image: courtesy of Common Networks]The wireless approach opens the door to new competitors like Starry and Common Networks, who can build out service at a fraction of cable’s costs. According to the Carmel Group, which conducted a study last year on behalf of the wireless internet industry, cable is 4.5 times more expensive to build than wireless home internet, and fiber is seven times more expensive.“No one’s been able to solve how you get that Main Street run down to Maple or Oak Street–how do we all get access to that infrastructure? That piece has definitely now been solved,” Shalek says.Why is all this happening now? Brock says it’s partly due to advances in software-based networking, which allows providers to adapt to network conditions on the fly. But it’s also because the cost of high-speed wireless radios, which require massive processing power, has plummeted in recent years.“It used to cost thousands of dollars per radio to do gigabit over the air,” Brock says. “You can now get chips that are in the dozens of dollars per radio.”Starry Point rooftop receiver [Photo: courtesy of Starry]Starry and Common Networks are hardly alone in building out this kind of service. In Starry’s launch market of Boston, another startup called NetBlazr offers similar wireless service, while PhillyWisper has begun taking on Comcast on its home turf in Philadelphia.“There are dozens of small companies around,” says Tim Horan, an analyst for Oppenheimer. “There’s starting to pop up all over the place.”The approach is also starting to win over telecom giants like Verizon, which has been turning to the same wireless spectrum–called “millimeter wave”–for its forthcoming “5G” internet service. Like Starry and Common Networks, Verizon wants to offer that service as a replacement for home internet, bundled with live TV service from providers such as YouTube. (And like those startups, Verizon is also starting slow, promising to launch in four markets in October.)Even so, Claude Aiken, president of the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (WISPA) trade group, believes there’s room for smaller companies to compete with larger providers due to the low cost of deployment.“This is a technology that has legs,” he says.The biggest question is how long this new breed of home internet service will take to get up and running.Common Networks’s Jessica Shalek says building out wireless service is harder and more time-consuming than it might seem, in part because the company has to make lots of software adjustments along the way. Providing reliable wireless service that accounts for things like weather, she says, is a difficult distributed systems and networking problem to solve.“Everything works in theory in the networking world, and it’s not like that when you’re in the real world,” she says. “When in you’re in real customer homes and on real rooftops, everything that worked in theory breaks down.”[Photo: courtesy of Common Networks]Oppenheimer’s Tim Horan also notes that there’s a lot of mundane work that goes into installing the base stations, even if they don’t involve digging through streets.“You’ve got to negotiate with all the building owners, you’ve got to get backhaul, you’ve got to get sites on rooftops, and then you’ve got to get repeater sites,” he says. “And they’re wiring each building individually, so there’s only so much manpower to do that.”At the same time, companies like Starry and Common Networks have to be careful not to expand beyond their means, especially when the promise of cheaper, better equipment is always around the corner.“You’ve got to time it where you’re getting revenues to support all that capex spending,” Horan says. “You just can’t go out and spend $20 million and not get any revenues on it.”Infrastructure isn’t the only issue. Wireless providers and trade groups like WISPA are also pushing the Federal Communications Commission to open up more spectrum, which will allow them to offer better service in more places. They’re also awaiting future technology improvements such as the 802.11ax wireless standard, which will allow for even faster speeds between base stations.But across multiple interviews, a simpler reality set in: Physically building these networks is an unavoidably long process.“It’s people, it’s hiring, and putting a team together, and building the actual physical deployment of the network,” says Virginia Lam Abrams, Starry’s senior vice president of communications and government relations. “It takes time to source vertical assets, and it takes time to build them out.”All of this means it could be at least another five years or more until wireless internet starts to feel competitive. That means having multiple options for high-speed internet at home, not being hostage to data caps, and not being beholden to one company’s video service when you’d rather use a competitor’s.As startups like Common Networks and Starry have discovered, the demand for such a thing already exists. All they have to do is finish building it.“That’s one area where we have a huge advantage,” Common Networks’ Jessica Shalek says. “This isn’t a product you have to convince people that they want.”Jared Newman covers apps and technology from his remote Cincinnati outpost.

"""If Windstream was hoping to make a splash with its new Kinetic IPTV service, Time Warner Cable certainly isn’t reaching for a towel.Kinetic debuted in April in Lincoln, Neb., the first community to get Windstream’s fiber to the neighborhood TV service. Three months after being introduced, it’s available in about half of the city. But it is not proving much of a threat to incumbent Time Warner Cable because Windstream set rates roughly the same or higher than what the cable company charges.In fact, a Stop the Cap! reader contemplating a trial run of Kinetic was quickly dissuaded when he learned Windstream charged $10 more than what he already paid Time Warner Cable.“Windstream either does not understand Time Warner’s pricing or is artificially trying to limit demand for the moment,” our reader tells us. “I have to believe it is one or the other because the alternative is they don’t know what they are doing and are creating an experiment built to fail. When I told Time Warner I was toying with the idea of trying Kinetic, they cut my bill another $30 a month and Kinetic is now dead to me.”Time Warner Cable’s customer retention department is well positioned to keep customers because it can sell faster Internet speeds at a lower price than Windstream has offered so far. The phone company obviously has no interest in starting a price war in Lincoln:The Lincoln Journal Star reports other customers have had similar experiences.Ryan Pryor said he inquired about Kinetic, but the price quoted was slightly more than what he now pays for a similar bundle with Time Warner and would have offered a slower Internet speed. So he chose to stick with what he has.Where Windstream has had some success is attracting current satellite customers. Jason Smith was tired of losing satellite service during storms and since he was already a Windstream DSL customer, upgrading to Kinetic made sense.“The picture quality has been very impressive,” Smith told the newspaper. “The one thing I noticed was how much better the picture looked than on DirecTV with the same HDMI connection to my TV.”Smith is also happy with a more capable whole house DVR and the fact Windstream offers wireless set-top boxes.But Smith also admitted he wasn’t sure if we would stick with the service long-term. A significant disadvantage of Kinetic is its reliance on copper wiring part of the way between Smith’s home and Windstream’s central office. All fiber to the neighborhood projects have bandwidth limitations that would not exist with a straight fiber to the home upgrade. Kinetic’s limits become clear when trying to watch three HD signals at once while being on the Internet. He can’t. Kinetic limits customers to two HD video streams at a time, compared with DirecTV’s five. Broadband speeds slow if other members of the household are also accessing telephone and television services.With competition like that, Time Warner Cable has done little to strengthen its position, with no immediate plans to upgrade service in the city. All that has changed recently is a channel realignment that groups like-channels together starting at channel 100. Time Warner began that nationwide channel realignment in Syracuse, N.Y., in the spring of 2013. More than two years later, that change is only now reaching Lincoln.Bryan Brooks, the Windstream vice president of business development, did not offer the newspaper many specifics about how Kinetic was performing, except to say demand has met expectations.“Since launch, we have consistently met our daily target numbers for installations and anticipate the number of residents interested in signing up for Kinetic to continue to grow,” Brooks said in an emailed statement. “We are very pleased with how Kinetic has been received in Lincoln.”The headquarters building of U.S. satellite TV operator DirecTV is seen in Los Angeles, California May 18, 2014. REUTERS/Jonathan AlcornWASHINGTON (Reuters) – AT&T Inc’s proposed $48.5 billion acquisition of DirecTV is expected to get U.S. regulatory approval as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the matter, a decision that will combine the country’s No. 2 wireless carrier with the largest satellite-TV provider.The Department of Justice, which assesses whether deals violate antitrust law, has completed its review of the merger and is waiting on the Federal Communications Commission to wrap up its own, according to three people familiar with the matter.The FCC, which reviews if deals are in public interest, is poised to approve the deal with conditions as early as next week, according to three other people familiar with the matter.All the sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media. An AT&T spokeswoman and FCC spokesman declined comment. Justice Department representatives were not immediately available for comment.AT&T’s merger with DirecTV, announced in May 2014, would create the country’s largest pay-TV company, giving DirecTV a broadband product and AT&T new avenues of growth beyond the maturing and increasingly competitive wireless service.The deal has been expected to pass regulatory muster in contrast with the rival mega-merger between cable and Internet providers Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which was rejected in April largely over the combined companies’ reach into the broadband market.The FCC and AT&T have been in negotiations over conditions for the merger for several weeks, the people said, adding that none of the conditions are controversial enough to break the deal.Those conditions are expected to include assurances that both middle-class and low-income Americans have access to affordable high-speed Internet, including an offering of broadband subscriptions as a standalone service without a TV bundle, according to two of the people.AT&T has earlier committed to expand access to broadband service in rural areas and to offer standalone Internet service at speeds of at least 6 Megabits per second to ensure consumers can access rival video services online, such as Netflix.FCC officials are also considering ways to ensure that the conditions are properly enforced in the future, possibly through a third-party monitor, according to the two sources.The FCC is also weighing how to ensure the merged companies abide by the so-called net neutrality rules, which regulate how Internet service providers manage traffic on their networks.AT&T has promised to abide by net neutrality principles such as no-blocking of traffic, but is challenging in court the FCC’s newest net neutrality regulations that have expanded the agency’s authority over various deals between Internet providers and content companies.FCC reviewers are weighing what net neutrality-related conditions to apply to the merger and how to address the possibility that the court throws out the latest rules, the two sources said.Reported by: Alina Selyukh and Diane BartzSprint’s all-new “All-In” wireless plan was supposed to simplify wireless pricing for consumers by bundling a leased phone, unlimited voice, data, and texting for a flat $80 a month, but customers slogging through the fine print discovered speed throttling and roaming punishments were silent passengers along for the ride:To improve data experience for the majority of users, throughput may be limited, varied or reduced on the network. Streaming video speeds will be limited to 600Kbps at all times, which may impact quality. Sprint may terminate service if off-network roaming usage in a month exceeds: (1) 800 min. or a majority of min.; or (2) 100MB or a majority of KB. Prohibited network use rules apply—see sprint.com/termsandconditions.Although many smaller wireless carriers also have limits on off-network roaming usage, none have proposed to permanently throttle web videos to a frustratingly slow 600kbps. At those speeds, Sprint customers could expect buffering delays or degraded HD video.Many customers contemplating switching to the All-In plan considered the speed throttle a deal-breaker and let Sprint know through its social media accounts. Even websites friendly to Sprint were very critical of the plan:Sprint 4G Rollout Updates:We just aren’t seeing the new and innovative thing with All In. You already have plans that price out the same way as All In (some even less expensive). It appears as a marketing gimmick that is disguising a desperate move to limit streaming. This is not popular with your current customers and your new customers are likely going to hate you for it. After they find out.
.
Marcelo, it’s really bad that David Beckham touts unlimited movie watching and you reference unlimited watching videos in your Press Release. 600kbps video streaming can hardly run any YouTube or Netflix streaming. It will buffer significantly even with the lowest resolution settings. 600kbps is insufficient for most moderate quality video streaming on a smartphone screen.ClaureSprint CEO Marcelo Claure got the message and announced late yesterday the video speed throttle was gone, but general network management would remain.“At Sprint, we strive to provide customers a great experience when using our network,” said Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure. “We heard you loud and clear, and we are removing the 600 kbps limitation on streaming video. During certain times, like other wireless carriers, we might have to manage the network in order to reduce congestion and provide a better customer experience for the majority of our customers.”Claure has been hinting the days of unlimited data from Sprint may be coming to an end sometime in the near future. Sprint is among the last carriers that offer a truly unlimited experience, and some customers have used Sprint as a home broadband replacement and have created congestion issues as they consume hundreds of gigabytes of wireless data, which can slow Sprint’s network to a crawl in some areas. T-Mobile experienced similar issues and recently updated their terms and conditions to apply a speed throttle after 21GB of usage during a billing cycle.Unlimited 4G LTE customers who use more than 21 GB of data in a bill cycle will have their data usage de-prioritized compared to other customers for that bill cycle at locations and times when competing network demands occur, resulting in relatively slower speeds. See t-mobile.com/OpenInternet for details.Customers report in high volume areas speeds drop well below 1Mbps if they are temporarily sentenced to “speed jail.”Many of those attempting to use a wireless carrier as their primary home broadband connection do not do so because of convenience or selfishness. Often, they have no other choice because they are bypassed by cable operators and not served by DSL. But it does not take too many customers to start creating problems for wireless carriers if a nearby cell tower becomes congested. Online video is probably the most bandwidth intensive application for wireless companies, especially HD video streaming. The growth of video traffic also raises questions about whether AT&T and Verizon’s efforts to move rural customers to an all-wireless phone and data platform will work well for the companies or customers.Frontier Communications scored dead last in a nationwide survey of websites run by 262 companies — ranked for their usability, helpfulness, and competence.The “2015 Web Experience Ratings,” conducted by the Temkin Group, a customer experience research and consulting firm, looked at how customers feel about companies based on experiences visiting their websites. The firm wanted to know whether customers would forgive a company if its website proved less than satisfactory. The answer appears to be no, and phone and cable companies were the most likely to experience the wrath of dissatisfied customers.“It’s ironic that many of the cable companies that provide Internet service earned such poor ratings,” Bruce Temkin, managing partner of Temkin Group, said.Most household name cable companies did especially poor in the survey. Time Warner Cable, Comcast and CenturyLink all tied at 252nd place (out of 262 firms). But special hatred was reserved for the website run by Frontier Communications, repeatedly called “incompetent” by consumers, especially after the phone company disabled most of the website’s self-service functions in late April. A well-placed source inside Frontier told Stop the Cap! the company could not manage to get its website ordering functions working properly and simply decided to give up, forcing customers to call instead.Only 29% of consumers were willing to forgive a telecommunications company for a lousy web experience, according to the findings. Other website disasters were run by: Cox Communications, Charter Communications, Spirit Airlines, Blue Shield of CA, and Haier.Which websites do consumers love the most? Temkin says USAA (a bank) and Amazon.com have traded the #1 and #2 spots for the last five years.West coast Internet users, particularly those around San Francisco and Sacramento, experienced major disruptions to the Internet last evening into this morning, affecting everything from cable television and phone service to popular online destinations including Amazon.com (and websites hosted by its AWS data service), Tinder, and Netflix.The range of disruptions led to early media speculation a “coordinated attack” on the Internet was underway on the west coast, but a statement from the Sacramento field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation this morning clarified it was investigating only a single case of alleged intentional vandalism in the San Francisco area today.The FBI suspects someone climbed down a manhole in Livermore early this morning and intentionally cut a high traffic fiber line owned by Level 3 and Zayo. This is not the first case of suspected vandalism. At least 10 other fiber line cuts in Fremont, Berkeley, San Jose, Alamo, and Walnut Creek have occurred in the Bay Area over the last year.[flv]http://www.phillipdampier.com/video/USA Today FBI investigating 11 attacks on San Francisco-area Internet lines 7-1-15.flv[/flv]USA Today reports the FBI is now investigating the 11th intentional fiber cut in the San Francisco Bay area in 12 months. (1:18)The hardest hit ISP was Wave Broadband in West Sacramento, Calif. The fiber outage wiped out cable, phone and broadband service for customers across Sacramento, Rocklin, and surrounding communities including Dixon.A broader issue yesterday evening also affected customers beyond northern California. Amazon.com and websites using its AWS platform suddenly stopped responding between 5:24pm-6:10pm PT last night. But that issue was later determined to be an unrelated “route leak” from Axcelx, a data center provider in Boston.Thousand Eyes reports that problem “affected a wide range of services including consumer internet sites like Yelp, Netflix and Match; SaaS services such as HipChat and Jobvite; and financial firms such as Experian and Zions Bank.”Any report of fiber vandalism concerns security experts, who suggest terrorists could target the highly visible data cables and create massive telecommunications disruptions in the United States.“When it’s situations that are scattered all in one geography, that raises the possibility that they are testing out capabilities, response times and impact,” JJ Thompson, CEO of Rook Security, told USA Today. “That is a security person’s nightmare.”[flv]http://www.phillipdampier.com/video/KCRA Sacramento Wave Broadband service restored after deliberate act 7-1-15.mp4[/flv]KCRA in Sacramento said the telecommunications outages in Sacramento were frustrating for businesses, residents, and local government — all affected by the fiber cut in San Francisco. (2:20)Fiber cables are also often readily identifiable by their bright orange insulation as well as from warning signs alerting construction crews and others to their presence underground.DownDetector clearly identifies the impact of the fiber outage affecting Wave Broadband in the Sacramento area.“There are flags and signs indicating to somebody who wants to do damage: This is where it is folks,” said Richard Doherty, research director of The Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment and market research firm. “You often have fiber from several companies sometimes going down the same street or the same trench. One attacker can dig one hole and wipe out service from three companies.”The FBI is asking for the public’s help in identifying the vandal in the Bay Area. In addition to this morning’s attack, anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in these earlier attacks should contact them at 415-553-7400.[flv]http://www.phillipdampier.com/video/KXTV Sacramento FBI Sacramento area internet outage result of vandalism 7-1-15.flv[/flv]KXTV in Sacramento reports the fiber cuts have immediate security and public safety implications for public officials. But network planners say no fiber cut should have disrupted so many customers and suggest better planning could have spared many from the service outage.

""Net neutrality"" is the term used to describe the concept of keeping the Internet open to all lawful content, information, applications, and equipment. There is increasing concern that the owners of the local broadband connections (usually either the cable or telephone company) may block or discriminate against certain Internet users or applications in order to give an advantage to their own services. While the owners of the local network have a legitimate right to manage traffic on their network to prevent congestion, viruses, and so forth, network owners should not be able to block or degrade traffic based on the identity of the user or the type of application solely to favor their interests.Subscribe to our emails and hear about the latest trends and new resources.""",,,

"""Posted on | March 15, 2020 | No CommentsMuch of the early success of the Internet in the USA can be attributed to the emergence of a unique organizational form, the Internet Service Provider or “ISP,” which became the dominant provider of Internet and broadband services in the 1990s. These organizations resulted from a unique set of regulatory directives that pushed the Internet’s development and created a competitive environment that encouraged the proliferation of ISPs and the spread of the World Wide Web. In this series on Internet policy, I look at the rise of the World Wide Web, the shift to broadband, deregulation, and consolidation of broadband services. Later in the series, I address the issue of net neutrality and raise the question, “Is Internet service a utility? Is it an essential service that should be made universally available to all Americans at regulated prices?The first ISPs began as US government-funded entities that served research and education communities of the early Internet. Secured by Al Gore in 1991, legislation signed by President George H. Bush created the model of the National Research and Education Network (NREN), a government-sponsored internet service provider dedicated to supporting the needs of the research and education communities within the US. Internet2, Merit, NYSERNET, OARnet, and KanRen were a few of the systems that provided schools, and other non-profit organizations access to the World Wide Web. While dialup services like Compuserve existed in the early 1980s, only later were the ISPs released for commercial traffic and services. While telecommunications carriers had been moving some Internet traffic since the late 1980s, their role expanded dramatically after the Internet began to allow commercial activities. In June of 1992 Congressman Rick Boucher (D-Va) introduced an amendment to the National Science Act of 1950 that allowed commercial activities on the US National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET). “A few months later, while waiting for Arkansas Governor William Jefferson Clinton to take over the Presidency, outgoing President George Bush, Sr. signed the Act into law.” The amendment allowed advertising and sales activities on the NSFNET. As part of the National Information Infrastructure (NII) plan, the US government decommissioned the US National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) in 1995. It had been the publicly financed backbone for most IP traffic in the US. The NII handed over interconnection to four Network Access Points (NAPs) in different parts of the country to create a bridge to the modern Internet of many private-sector competitors. These NAPS contracted with the big commercial carriers such as Ameritech, Pacific Bell, and Sprint for new facilities to form a network-of-networks, anchored around Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). The former regional Bell companies were to be primarily wholesalers, interconnecting with ISPs. This relatively easy process of connecting routers was to put the “inter” in the Internet but also became sites of performance degradation and unequal power relations. As the Internet took off in the late 1990s, thousands of new ISPs set up business to commercialize the Internet. The major markets for ISPs were: 1) access services, 2) wholesale IP services, and 3) value-added services offered to individuals and corporations. Access services were provided for both individual and corporate accounts and involved connecting them to the Internet via dial-up, ISDN, T-1, frame-relay or other network connections. Wholesale IP services were primarily offered by facilities-based providers like MCI, Sprint, and WorldCom UUNET (a spinoff of a DOD-funded seismic research facility) and involved providing leased capacity over its backbone networks. Value-added services included web-hosting, e-commerce, and networked resident security services. By the end of 1997, over 4,900 ISPs existed in North America, although most of them had fewer than 3,000 subscribers.[2] See the below video and this response for how much things have changed. FCC policy had allowed unlimited local phone calling for enhanced computer services and early Internet users connected to their local ISP using their modems over POTS (Plain Old Telephone System). ISPs quickly developed software that was put on CD-ROMs that could be easily installed on a personal computer. The software usually put an icon on the desktop screen of the computer that when clicked on would dial the ISP automatically, provide the password, and connect the user to Internet. A company called Netscape created a popular “browser” that allowed text and images to be displayed on the screen. The browser used what was called the World Wide Web, a system of accessing files quickly from computer servers all over the globe. The ISPs emerged as an important component to the Internet’s accessibility and were greatly aided by US government policy. The distinctions made in the FCC’s Second Computer Inquiry in 1981 allowed ISPs to bypass many of the regulatory roadblocks experienced by traditional communication carriers. Telcos were to provide regulated basic services and “enhanced services” were to stay unregulated. Schiller explained: ISPs looked to equip themselves for potential new markets and also connect with other companies. For example, IBM and telecom provider Qwest hooked up to offer web hosting services. PSINet bought Metamor to not only transfer data but to host, design, and move companies from the old software environment to the new environment. ISPs increasing saw themselves as not only providers of a transparent data pipe but also as a provider of value-added services such as web hosting, colocation, and support for domain name registration.The next part of this series will discuss the shift to higher speed broadband capabilities. Later, the consolidation of the industries starting in 2005 when the FCC changed the regulatory regime for wireline broadband services. Notes[1] Hundt, R. (2000) You Say You Want a Revolution?

"""The Association of Research Libraries (ARL), EDUCAUSE, Internet2, NYSERNet and ACUTA have published comments, welcoming an initiative to preserve the openness of the Internet. The comments are part of a joint filing to the US’ Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the Net Neutrality proceedings. 

The non-profit organisations ARL, EDUCAUSE and Internet2 have expressed support for the codification of the six principles outlined in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). They have also urged the FCC to adopt clear, enforceable rules to preserve the openness of the Internet as soon as possible. ARL and EDUCAUSE - both members of the Open Internet Coalition – have also endorsed the Coalition’s comments in this proceeding.

According to the organisations, research libraries and higher education institutions rely on an open Internet to collaborate and to obtain important services and content from outside sources. It is expected that neutrality rules would preserve the benefits that flow from the Internet’s open, democratic nature. By keeping broadband providers from raising artificial price barriers and stifling open debate, Net neutrality would preserve the principles that have made the Internet a competitive market for ideas as well as goods and services.

"""Creatures of ThoughtIn the summer of 1986, Senator Al Gore, Jr., of Tennessee introduced an amendment to the Congressional Act that authorized the  budget of the National Science Foundation (NSF). He called for the federal government to study the possibilities for “communications networks for supercomputers at universities and Federal research facilities.” To explain the purpose of this legislation, Gore called on a striking analogy: One promising technology is the development of fiber optic systems for voice and data transmission. Eventually we will see a system of fiber optic systems being installed nationwide. America’s highways transport people and materials across the country. Federal freeways connect with state highways which connect in turn with county roads and city streets. To transport data and ideas, we will need a telecommunications highway connecting users coast to coast, state to state, city to city. The study required in this amendment will identify the problems and opportunities the nation will face in establishing that highway.1In the following years, Gore and his allies would call for the creation of an “information superhighway”, or, more formally, a national information infrastructure (NII). As he intended, Gore’s analogy to the federal highway system summons to mind a central exchange that would bind together various local and regional networks, letting all American citizens communicate with one another. However, the analogy also misleads – Gore did not propose the creation of a federally-funded and maintained data network. He envisioned that the information superhighway, unlike its concrete and asphalt namesake, would come into being through the action of market forces, within a regulatory framework that would ensure competition, guarantee open, equal access to any service provider (what would later be known as “net neutrality”), and provide subsidies or other mechanisms to ensure universal service to the least fortunate members of society, preventing the emergence of a gap between the information rich and information poor.2Over the following decade, Congress slowly developed a policy response to the growing importance of computer networks to the American research community, to education, and eventually to society as a whole. Congress’ slow march towards an NII policy, however, could not keep up with the rapidly growing NSFNET, overseen by the neighboring bureaucracy of the executive branch. Despite its reputation for sclerosis, bureaucracy was created exactly because of its capacity, unlike a legislature, to respond to events immediately, without deliberation. And so it happened that, between 1988 and 1993, the NSF crafted the policies that would determine how the Internet became private, and thus went public. It had to deal every year with novel demands and expectations from NSFNET’s users and peer networks. In response, it made decisions on the fly, decisions which rapidly outpaced Congressional plans for guiding the development of an information superhighway. These decisions rested largely in the hands of a single man – Stephen Wolff.Wolff earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Princeton in 1961 (where he would have been a rough contemporary of Bob Kahn), and began what might have been a comfortable academic career, with a post-doctoral stint at Imperial College, followed by several years teaching at Johns Hopkins. But then he shifted gears, and took a position  at the Ballistics Research lab in Aberdeen, Maryland. He stayed there for most of the 1970s and early 1980s, researching communications and computing systems for the U.S. Army. He introduced Unix into the lab’s offices, and managed Aberdeen’s connection to the ARPANET.3In 1986, the NSF recruited him to manage the NSF’s supercomputing backbone – he was a natural fit, given his experience connecting Army supercomputers to ARPANET. He became the principal architect of NSFNET’s evolution from that point until his departure in 1994, when he entered the private sector as a manager for Cisco Systems. The original intended function of the net that Wolff was hired to manage had been to connect researchers across the U.S. to NSF-funded supercomputing centers. As we saw last time, however, once Wolff and the other network managers saw how much demand the initial backbone had engendered, they quickly developed a new vision of NSFNET, as a communications grid for the entire American research and post-secondary education community.However, Wolff did not want the government to be in the business of supplying network services on a permanent basis. In his view, the NSF’s role was to prime the pump, creating the initial demand needed to get a commercial networking services sector off the ground. Once that happened, Wolff felt it would be improper for a government entity to be in competition with viable for-profit businesses. So he intended to get NSF out of the way by privatizing the network, handing over control of the backbone to unsubsidized private entities and letting the market take over.This was very much in the spirit of the times. Across the Western world, and across most of the political spectrum, government leaders of the 1980s touted privatization and deregulation as the best means to unleash economic growth and innovation after the relative stagnation of the 1970s. As one example among many, around the same time that NSFNET was getting off the ground, the FCC knocked down several decades-old constraints on corporations involved in broadcasting. In 1985, it removed the restriction on owning print and broadcast media in the same locality, and two year later it nullified the fairness doctrine, which had required broadcasters to present multiple views on public-policy debates. From his post at NSF, Wolff had several levers at hand for accomplishing his goals. The first lay in the interpretation and enforcement of the network’s acceptable use policy (AUP). In accordance with NSF’s mission, the initial policy for the NSFNET backbone, in effect until June 1990, required all uses of the network to be in support of “scientific research and other scholarly activities.” This is quite restrictive indeed, and would seem to eliminate any possibility of commercial use of the network. But Wolff chose to interpret the policy liberally. Regularly mailing list postings about new product releases from a corporation that sold data processing software – was that not in support of scientific research? What about the decision to allow MCI’s email system to connect to the backbone, at the urging of Vint Cerf, who had left government employ to oversee the development of MCI Mail. Wolff rationalized this – and other later interconnections to commercial email systems such as CompuServe’s – as in support of research by making it possible for researchers to communicate digitally with a wider range of people that they might need to contact in the pursuit of their work. A stretch, perhaps. But Wolff saw that allowing some commercial traffic on the same infrastructure that was used for public NSF traffic would encourage the private investment needed to support academic and educational use on a permanent basis. Wolff’s strategy of opening the door of NSFNET as far as possible to commercial entities got an assist from Congress in 1992, when Congressman Rick Boucher, who helped oversee NSF as chair of the Science Subcommittee, sponsored an amendment to the NSF charter which authorized any additional uses of NSFNET that would “tend to increase the overall capabilities of the networks to support such research and education activities.” This was an ex post facto validation of Wolff’s approach to commercial traffic, allowing virtually any activity as long as it produced profits that encouraged more private investment into NSFNET and its peer networks.  Wolff also fostered the commercial development of networking by supporting the regional networks’ reuse of their networking hardware for commercial traffic. As you may recall, the NSF backbone linked together a variety of not-for-profit regional nets, from NYSERNet in New York to Sesquinet in Texas to BARRNet in northern California. NSF did not directly fund the regional networks, but it did subsidize them indirectly, via the money it provided to labs and universities to offset the costs of their connection to their neighborhood regional net. Several of the regional nets then used this same subsidized infrastructure to spin off a for-profit commercial enterprise, selling network access to the public over the very same wires used for the research and education purposes sponsored by NSF. Wolff encouraged them to do so, seeing this as yet another way to accelerate the transition of the nation’s research and education infrastructure to private control. This, too, accorded neatly with the political spirit of the 1980s, which encouraged private enterprise to profit from public largesse, in the expectation that the public would benefit indirectly through economic growth. One can see parallels with the dual-use regional networks in the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which defaulted ownership of patents derived from government-funded research to the organization performing the work, not to the government that paid for it. The most prominent example of dual-use in action was PSINet, a for-profit company initially founded as Performance Systems International in 1988. William Schrader and Martin Schoffstall, the co-founder of NYSERNet and one of vice presidents’, respectively, created the company. Schofstall, a former BBN engineer and co-author of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing the devices on an IP network, was the key technical leader. Schrader, an ambitious Cornell biology major and MBA who had helped his alma mater set up its supercomputing center and get it connected to NSFNET, provided the business drive. He firmly believed that NYSERNet should be selling service to businesses, not just educational institutions. When the rest of the board disagreed, he quit to found his own company, first contracting with NYSERNet for service, and later raising enough money to acquire its assets. PSINet thus became one of the earliest commercial internet service providers, while continuing to provide non-profit service to colleges and universities seeking access to the NSFNET backbone.4Wolff’s final source of leverage for encouraging a commercial Internet lay in his role as manager of the contracts with the Merit-IBM-MCI consortium that operated the backbone. The initial impetus for change in this dimension came not from Wolff, however, but from the backbone operators themselves.  MCI and its peers in the telecommunications industry had a strong incentive to find or create more demand for computer data communications. They had spent the 1980s upgrading their long-line networks from coaxial cable and microwave – already much higher capacity than the old copper lines – to fiber optic cables. These cables, which transmitted laser light through glass, had tremendous capacity, limited mainly by the technology in the transmitters and receivers on either end, rather than the cable itself. And that capacity was far from saturated. By the early 1990s, many companies had deployed OC-48 transmission equipment with 2.5 Gbps of capacity, an almost unimaginable figure a decade earlier. An explosion in data traffic would therefore bring in new revenue at very little marginal cost – almost pure profit.5The desire to gain expertise in the coming market in data communications helps explains why MCI was willing to sign on to the NSFNET bid proposed by Merit, which massively undercut the competing bids (at $14 million for five years, versus the $40 and $25 millions proposed by their competitors6), and surely implied a short-term financial loss for MCI and IBM. But by 1989, they hoped to start turning a profit from their investment. The existing backbone was approaching the saturation point, with 500 million packets a month, a 500% year-over-year increase.7 So, when NSF asked Merit to upgrade the backbone from 1.5 Mbps T1 lines to 45Mbps T3, they took the opportunity to propose to Wolff a new contractual arrangement.T3 was a new frontier in networking – no prior experience or equipment existed for digital networks of this bandwidth, and so the companies argued that more private investment would be needed, requiring a restructuring that would allow IBM and Merit to share the new infrastructure with for-profit commercial traffic – a dual-use backbone. To achieve this, the consortium would from a new non-profit corporation, Advanced Network & Services, Inc. (ANS), which would supply T3 networking services to NSF. A subsidiary called ANS CO+RE systems would sell the same services at a profit to any clients willing to pay. Wolff agreed to this, seeing it as just another step in the transition of the network towards commercial control. Moreover, he feared that continuing to block commercial exploitation of the backbone would lead to a bifurcation of the network, with suppliers like ANS doing an end-run around NSFNET to create their own, separate, commercial Internet. Up to that point, Wolff’s plan for gradually getting NSF out of the way had no specific target date or planned milestones. A workshop on the topic held at Harvard in March 1990, in which Wolff and many other early Internet leaders participated, considered a variety of options without laying out any concrete plans.8 It was ANS’ stratagem that triggered the cascade of events that led directly to the full privatization and commercialization of NSFNET.It began with a backlash. Despite Wolff’s good intentions, IBM and MCI’s ANS maneuver created a great deal of disgruntlement in the networking community. It became a problem exactly because of the for-profit networks attached to the backbone that Wolff had promoted. So far they had gotten along reasonably with one another, because they all operated as peers on the same terms. But with ANS, a for-profit company held a de-facto monopoly on the backbone at the center of the Internet.9 Moreover, despite Wolff’s efforts to interpret the AUP loosely, ANS chose to interpret it strictly, and refused to interconnect the non-profit portion of the backbone (for NSF traffic) with any of their for-profit networks like PSI, since that would require a direct mixing of commercial and non-commercial traffic. When this created an uproar, they backpedaled, and came up with a new policy, allowing interconnection for a fee based on traffic volume.PSINet would have none of this. In the summer of 1991, they banded together with two other for-profit Internet service providers – UUNET, which had begun by selling commercial access to Usenet before adding Internet service; and the California Education and Research Federation Network, or CERFNet, operated by General Atomics – to form their own exchange, bypassing the ANS backbone. The Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) consisted at first of just a single routing center in Washington D.C. which could transfer traffic among the three networks. They agreed to peer at no charge, regardless of the relative traffic volume, with each network paying the same fee to CIX to operate the router. New routers in Chicago and Silicon Valley soon followed, and other networks looking to avoid ANS’ fees also joined on.Rick Boucher, the Congressman whom we met above as a supporter of NSF commercialization, nonetheless requested an investigation of the propriety of Wolff’s actions in the ANS affair by the Office of the Inspector General. It found NSF’s actions precipitous, but not malicious or corrupt. Nevertheless, Wolff saw that the time had come to divest control of the backbone. With ANS + CORE and CIX privatization and commercialization had begun in earnest, but in a way that risked splitting the unitary Internet into multiple disconnected fragments, as CIX and ANS refused to connect with one another. NSF therefore drafted a plan for a new, privatized network architecture in the summer of 1992, released it for public comment, and finalized it in May of 1993. NSFNET would shut down in the spring of 1995, and its assets would revert to IBM and MCI. The regional networks could continue to operate, with financial support from the NSF gradually phasing out over a four year period, but would have to contract with a private ISP for internet access.But in a world of many competitive internet access providers, what would replace the backbone? What mechanism would link these opposed private interests into a cohesive whole? Wolff’s answer was inspired by the exchanges already built by cooperatives like CIX – NSF would contract out the creation of four Network Access Points (NAPs), routing sites where various vendors could exchange traffic. Having four separate contracts would avoid repeating the ANS controversy, by preventing a monopoly on the points of exchange. One NAP would reside at the pre-existing, and cheekily named, Metropolitan Area Ethernet East (MAE-East) in Vienna, Virginia, operated by Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS). MAE-West, operated by Pacific Bell, was established in San Jose, California; Sprint operated another NAP in Pennsauken, New Jersey, and Ameritech one in Chicago. The transition went smoothly10, and NSF decommissioned the backbone right on schedule, on April 30, 1995.11Though Gore and others often invoked the “information superhighway” as a metaphor for digital networks, there was never serious consideration in Congress of using the federal highway system as a direct policy model. The federal government paid for the building and maintenance of interstate highways in order to provide a robust transportation network for the entire country. But in an era when both major parties took deregulation and privatization for granted as good policy, a state-backed system of networks and information services on the French model of Transpac and Minitel was not up for consideration.12Instead, the most attractive policy model for Congress as it planned for the future of telecommunication was the long-distance market created by the break-up of the Bell System between 1982 and 1984. In 1974, the Justice Department filed suit against AT&T, its first major suit against the organization since the 1950s, alleging that it had engaged in anti-competitive behavior in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Specifically, they accused the company of using its market power to exclude various innovative new businesses from the market – mobile radio operators, data networks, satellite carriers, makers of specialized terminal equipment, and more. The suit thus clearly drew much of its impetus from the ongoing disputes since the early 1960s (described in an earlier installment), between AT&T and the likes of MCI and Carterfone.When it became clear that the Justice Department meant business, and intended to break the power of AT&T, the company at first sought redress from Congress. John de Butts, chairman and CEO since 1972, attempted to push a “Bell bill” – formally the Consumer Communications Reform Act – through Congress. It would have enshrined into law AT&T’s argument that the benefits of a single, universal telephone network far outweighed any risk of abusive monopoly, risks which in any case the FCC could already effectively check. But the proposal received stiff opposition in the House Subcommittee on Communications, and never reached a vote on the floor of either Congressional chamber. In a change of tactics, in 1979 the board replaced the combative de Butts – who had once declared openly to an audience of state telecommunications regulators the heresy that he opposed competition and espoused monopoly – with the more conciliatory Charles Brown. But it was too late by then to stop the momentum of the antitrust case, and it became increasingly clear to the company’s leadership that they would not prevail. In January 1982, therefore, Brown agreed to a consent decree that would have the presiding judge in the case, Harold Greene, oversee the break-up of the Bell System into its constituent parts.The various Bell companies that brought copper to the customer’s premise, which generally operated by state (New Jersey Bell, Indiana Bell, and so forth) were carved up into seven blocks called Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). Working clockwise around the country, they were NYNEX in the northeast, Bell Atlantic, Bell South, Southwestern Bell, Pacific Telesis, US West, and Ameritech. All of them remained regulated entities with an effective monopoly over local traffic in their region, but were forbidden from entering other telecom markets. AT&T itself retained the “long lines” division for long-distance traffic. Unlike local phone service, however, the settlement opened this market to free competition from any entrant willing and able to pay the interconnection fees to transfer calls in and out of the RBOCs. A residential customer in Indiana would always have Ameritech as their local telephone company, but could sign up for long-distance service with anyone.However, splitting apart the local and long-distance markets meant forgoing the subsidies that AT&T had long routed to rural telephone subscribers, under-charging them by over-charging wealthy long-distance users. A sudden spike in rural telephone prices across the nation was not politically tenable, so the deal preserved these transfers via a new organization, the non-profit National Exchange Carrier Association, which collected fees from the long-distance companies and distributed them to the RBOCS.   The new structure worked. Two major competitors entered the market in the 1980s, MCI and Sprint, and cut deeply into AT&T’s market share. Long-distance prices fell rapidly. Though it is arguable how much of this was due to competition per se, as opposed to the advent of ultra-high-bandwidth fiber optic networks, the arrangement was generally seen as a great success for de-regulation and a clear argument for the power of market forces to modernize formerly hidebound industries. This market structure, created ad hoc by court fiat but evidently highly successful, provided the template from which Congress drew in the mid-1990s to finally resolve the question of what telecom policy for the Internet era would look like. Prior to the main event, there was one brief preliminary. The High Performance Computing Act of 1991 was important tactically, but not strategically. It advanced no new major policy initiatives. Its primary significance lay in providing additional funding and Congressional backing for what Wolff and the NSF already were doing and intended to keep doing – providing networking services for the research community, subsidizing academic institutions’ connections to NSFNET, and continuing to upgrade the backbone infrastructure.  Then came the accession of the 104th Congress in January 1995. Republicans took control of both the Senate and the House for the first time in forty years, and they came with an agenda to fight crime, cut taxes, shrink and reform government, and uphold moral righteousness. Gore and his allies had long touted universal access as a key component of the National Information Infrastructure, but with this shift in power the prospects for a strong universal service component to telecommunications reform diminished from minimal to none. Instead, the main legislative course would consist of regulatory changes to foster competition in telecommunications and Internet access, with a serving of bowdlerization on the side. The market conditions looked promising. Circa 1992, the major players in the telecommunications industry were numerous. In the traditional telephone industry there were the seven RBOCs, GTE, and three large long distance companies – AT&T, MCI, and Sprint – along with many smaller ones. The new up-and-comers included Internet service providers, such as UUNET, and PSINET as well as the IBM/MCI backbone spin-off, ANS; and other companies trying to build out their local fiber networks, such as Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS). BBN, the contractor behind ARPANET, had begun to build its own small Internet empire, snapping up some of the regional networks that orbited around NSFNET – Nearnet in New England, BARRNet in the Bay area, and SURANet in the southeast of the U.S. To preserve and expand this competitive landscape would be the primary goal of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the only major rewrite of communications policy since the Communications Act of 1934. It intended to reshape telecommunications law for the digital age. The regulatory regime established by the original act siloed industries by their physical transmission medium – telephony, broadcast radio and television, cable TV; in each in its own box, with its own rules, and generally forbidden to meddle in each other’s business. As we have seen, sometimes regulators even created silos within silos, segregating the long-distance and local telephone markets. This made less and less sense as media of all types were reduced to fungible digital bits, which could be commingled on the same optical fiber, satellite transmission, or ethernet cable. The intent of the 1996 Act, shared by Democrats and Republicans alike, was to tear down these barriers, these “Berlin Walls of regulation”, as Gore’s own summary of the act put it.13 A complete itemization of the regulatory changes in this doorstopper of a bill is not possible here, but a few examples provide a taste of its character. Among other things it:The risk, though, of simply removing all regulation, opening the floodgates and letting any entity participate in any market, was to recreate AT&T on an even larger scale, a monopolistic megacorp that would dominate all forms of communication and stifle all competitors. Most worrisome of all was control over the so-called last mile – from the local switching office to the customer’s home or office. Building an inter-urban network connecting the major cities of the U.S. was expensive but not prohibitive, several companies had done so in recent decades, from Sprint to UUNET. To replicate all the copper or cable to every home in even one urban area, was another matter. Local competition in landline communications had scarcely existed since the early wildcat days of the telephone, when tangled skeins of iron wire criss-crossed urban streets. In the case of the Internet, the concern centered especially on high-speed, direct-to-the-premises data services, later known as broadband. For years, competition had flourished among dial-up Internet access providers, because all the end user required to reach the provider’s computer was access to a dial tone. But this would not be the case by default for newer services that did not use the dial telephone network. The legislative solution to this conundrum was to create the concept of the “CLEC” – competitive local exchange carrier. The RBOCs, now referred to as “ILECs” (incumbent local exchange carriers), would be allowed full, unrestricted access to the long-distance market only once the had unbundled their networks by allowing the CLECs, which would provide their own telecommunications services to homes and businesses, to interconnect with and lease the incumbents’ infrastructure. This would enable competitive ISPs and other new  service providers to continue to get access to the local loop even when dial-up service became obsolete – creating, in effect, a dial tone for broadband. The CLECs, in this model, filled the same role as the long-distance providers in the post-break-up telephone market. Able to freely interconnect at reasonable fees to the existing local phone networks, they would inject competition into a market previously dominated by the problem of natural monopoly. Besides the creation of the CLECS, the other major part of the bill that affected the Internet addressed the Republicans’ moral agenda rather than their economic one. Title V, known as the Communications Decency Act, forbade the transmission of indecent or offensive material – depicting or describing “sexual or excretory activities or organs”, on any part of the Internet accessible to minors. This, in effect, was an extension of the obscenity and indecent rules that governed broadcasting into the world of interactive computing services. How, then, did this sweeping act fare in achieving its goals? In most dimensions it proved a failure. Easiest to dispose with is the Communications Decency Act, which the Supreme Court struck down quickly (in 1997) as a violation of the First Amendment. Several parts of Title V did survive review however, including Section 230, the most important piece of the entire bill for the Internet’s future. It allows websites that host user-created content to exist without the fear of constant lawsuits, and protects the continued existence of everything from giants like Facebook and Twitter to tiny hobby bulletin boards. The fate of the efforts to promote competition within the local loop took longer to play out, but proved no more successful than the controls on obscenity. What about the CLECs, given access to the incumbent cable and telephone infrastructure so that they could compete on price and service offerings? The law required FCC rulemaking to hash out the details of exactly what kind of unbundling had to be offered. The incumbents pressed the courts hard to dispute any such ruling that would open up their lines to competition, repeatedly winning injunctions on the FCC, while threatening that introducing competitors would halt their imminent plans for bringing fiber to the home. Then, with the arrival of the Bush Administration and new chairman Michael Powell in 2001, the FCC became actively hostile to the original goals of the Telecommunications Act. Powell believed that the need for alternative broadband access would be satisfied by intermodal competition among cable, telephone, power communications networks, cellular and wireless networks. No more FCC rules in favor of CLECs would be forthcoming. For a brief time around the year 2000, it was possible to subscribe to third-party high-speed internet access using the infrastructure of your local telephone or cable provider. After that, the most central of the Telecom Act’s  pro-competitive measures became, in effect, a dead letter. The much ballyhooed fiber-to-the home only began to actually reach a significant number of homes after 2010, and the only with reluctance on the part of the incumbents.14 As author Fred Goldstein put it, the incumbents had “gained a fig leaf of competition without accepting serious market share losses.”15During most of the twentieth century, networked industries in the U.S. had sprouted in a burst of entrepreneurial energy and then been fitted into the matrix of a regulatory framework as they grew large and important enough to affect the public interest. Broadcasting and cable television had followed this pattern. So had trucking and the airlines. But with the CLECs all but dead by the early 2000s, the Communications Decency Act revoked, and other attempts to control the Internet such as the Clipper chip16 stymied, the Internet would follow an opposite course. Having come to life under the guiding hand of the state, it would now be allowed to develop in an almost entirely laissez-faire fashion. The NAP framework established by the NSF at the hand-off of the backbone would be the last major government intervention in the structure of the Internet. This was true at both the transport layer – the networks such as Verizon and AT&T that transported raw data, and the applications layer – software services from portals like Yahoo! to search engines like Google to online stores like Amazon.  In our last chapter, we will look at the consequences of this fact, briefly sketching the evolution of the Internet in the U.S. from the mid-1990s onward. [Previous] [Next]Janet Abatte, Inventing the Internet (1999)Karen D.
