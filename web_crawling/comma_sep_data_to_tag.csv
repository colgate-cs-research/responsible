2016 Cogent's Schaeffer: NetNeutrality turnback won't impact interconnection agreements with AT&T,,,,cogent communications
a company whose spats with ISPs over blocking traffic has become stuff of legend in the telecom industry,,,,cogent communications
says that the FCC’s plan to overturn the 2015 NetNeutrality order is a mistake.,,,,cogent communications
“It’s almost a certainty on a 3,,,,cogent communications

RELATED: Cogent’s Netcentric business growth at risk from NetNeutrality changes,,,,cogent communications
which provides fiber and IP transit services to ISPs and content providers like Netflix,,,,cogent communications
the current NetNeutrality rules emerged following battles with eight service providers that would not upgrade their interconnection points.,,,,cogent communications
"“The regulatory oversight that was put in place in June 2015 was beneficial to us and it helped us go to a group of 8 ISPs who methodically began blocking their customers’ connectivity to the internet by refusing the upgrade the interconnection points,” Schaeffer said.",,,,cogent communications
Cogent is seeing overall traffic rising in its Netcentric business—the unit that sells connectivity to content providers and other wholesale customers—but potential changes in NetNeutrality rules could cause headwinds in the near term.,,,,cogent communications
Wells Fargo said in a recent research note that while Netcentric is growing,,,,cogent communications
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s commitment to realigning NetNeutrality rules might dissuade content provider customers from aggressively rolling out new products.,,,,cogent communications
“While some recent trends suggest it's modestly improving,,,,cogent communications

NetNeutrality has traditionally referred to the principle that Internet providers shouldn't block or manipulate traffic once it's on their networks.,,,,cogent communications
and Level 3 all lobbied the FCC to include the interconnection issue as part of its NetNeutrality rules.,,,,cogent communications

California established the gold standard of what states should be doing on NetNeutrality by passing a model law for other states to copy.,,,,NYSERNET
that makes the job of any legislator truly interested in protecting NetNeutrality pretty easy: just copy and paste.,,,,NYSERNET
State Senator Kevin Parker,,,,NYSERNET
the Senate Telecommunications Chairman,,,,NYSERNET
has instead introduced S. 8020,,,,NYSERNET
legislation that not only ignores critical NetNeutrality issues such as zero rating,,,,NYSERNET
but it would legalize PaidPrioritization by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).,,,,NYSERNET
The FCC in the final days before the repeal effort of NetNeutrality began taking extraordinary steps to shut down investigations into ISP practices and rescind government findings that the zero,,,,NYSERNET
rating practices of AT&T had,,,,NYSERNET
violated the 2015 OpenInternet Order.,,,,NYSERNET
When the fight to restore NetNeutrality came to California,,,,NYSERNET
organizations that advocate for the interest of low,,,,NYSERNET
income people fought hard to protect low,,,,NYSERNET
income users with zero,,,,NYSERNET
rating protections in the law.,,,,NYSERNET
In hopes of preserving their anti,,,,NYSERNET
AT&T issued phony studies about how zero rating was good for people and then later resorted to robocalling senior citizens about rising phone bills if the state passed NetNeutrality.,,,,NYSERNET
But S. 8020 would give ISPs the right to engage in PaidPrioritization as long as the company believes it is good for Internet users.,,,,NYSERNET
It’s possible that the senator has bought into the myths ISPs like to share in favor of PaidPrioritization,,,,NYSERNET
such as claims that it is necessary for remote surgery (it isn’t) or that Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are the same thing as ISPs.,,,,NYSERNET
We are disappointed to see these behaviors promoted by S. 8020,,,,NYSERNET
and call on the state of New York to back a real NetNeutrality bill—one that protects consumers and promotes innovation,,,,NYSERNET
rather than one that protects the interests of powerful incumbents looking to pad their pockets.,,,,NYSERNET
NetNeutrality is the term used to describe the concept of keeping the Internet open to all lawful content,,,,NYSERNET
There is increasing concern that the owners of the local broadband connections (usually either the cable or telephone company) may block or discriminate against certain Internet users or applications in order to give an advantage to their own services.,,,,NYSERNET
While the owners of the local network have a legitimate right to manage traffic on their network to prevent congestion,,,,NYSERNET
and so forth,,,,NYSERNET
network owners should not be able to block or degrade traffic based on the identity of the user or the type of application solely to favor their interests.,,,,NYSERNET
The mixed ruling,,,,NYSERNET
by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,,,,NYSERNET
ensures that debate about so,,,,NYSERNET
called NetNeutrality rules will continue,,,,NYSERNET
including in state capitals.,,,,NYSERNET
The rules had prohibited broadband internet providers like Comcast and AT&T from blocking websites or charging for higher,,,,NYSERNET
quality service or certain content.,,,,NYSERNET
Mr. Pai said the decision was “a victory for consumers,,,,NYSERNET
broadband deployment and the free and OpenInternet.” He said the commission looked forward to addressing the “narrow issues” that the court sent back to the commission.,,,,NYSERNET
Supporters of NetNeutrality rules say that because of the repeal,,,,NYSERNET
consumers will have more difficulty getting access to online content and start,,,,NYSERNET
ups will have to pay to reach consumers.,,,,NYSERNET
Tuesday’s ruling may clear a major roadblock to California’s enforcement of the law,,,,NYSERNET
although it is still likely to face legal challenges.,,,,NYSERNET
official told reporters during a phone call that the agency was still analyzing how the opinion would affect its ability to block state and local regulations — but said the agency believed the court had not curtailed its efforts outright.,,,,NYSERNET
