									All our software solutions leverage their 
									position in the data path to help operators 
									become more aware of the devices, content,

									content storage ensures that providers can

									shared, while a personalized communications 
									dashboard simplifies the very act of 
									communicating � supporting email, voice, 
									chat, posts and tweets.

Openwave History

									Openwave was formed in August 2000 when 
									wireless Internet pioneer Phone.com merged 
									with messaging software provider 
									Software.com. This union signaled a larger 
									trend taking shape in the industry -- the 
									convergence of broadband and mobile 
									communications as traditional 
									telecommunications intersected with the 
									Internet.
