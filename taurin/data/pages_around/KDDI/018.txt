##TITLE: AMS-IX will decommission New York
##METHOD: paragraphs

AMS-IX has decided to decommission the New York location by the end of Q3, 2018.
In April 2014, AMS-IX USA Inc. opened the AMS-IX New York Internet Exchange. Part of our current strategy is to evaluate our existing locations, services and products.
As a result of the evaluation, the business decision has been taken to decommission the New York Internet Exchange and thus, focus our efforts on the further development of the AMS-IX Bay Area and Chicago Exchanges.
The expansion to the USA was at that time in line with our strategy to expand abroad. Expansions are still in line with our strategy, as AMS-IX still has focus to explore new markets.
AMS-IX USA New York will be decommissioned at the end of Q3 2018.
