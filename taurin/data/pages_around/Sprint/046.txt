 Count Sprint among the companies celebrating the Federal Communications Commission’s ruling to protect net neutrality. 
 The FCC voted on Thursday to impose new rules that will treat broadband Internet as a telecom service under Title II of the Telecommunication Act. The decision is viewed as a victory for supporters of the so-called “open internet,” as it ensures service providers can’t block or throttle data speeds or create Internet “fast lanes.” 
 Opponents of net neutrality say the move will squelch innovation. But Sprint, the Overland Park, Kan.-based telecom company, and other supporters view the FCC’s decision as a win for consumers. 
 “We believe balanced net neutrality rules with a light regulatory touch will benefit consumers, while fostering mobile broadband competition, investment and innovation in the United States,” the company said in a statement. “We look forward to reviewing the FCC order and continuing to work with policymakers to ensure consumers benefit from an open Internet.”
