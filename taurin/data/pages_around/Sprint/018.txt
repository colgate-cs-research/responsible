 Sprint stopped slowing traffic on its network for customers who use a lot of data in order to make sure it is complying with the new net neutrality rules,  The   Wall Street Journa l  reported . It’s one of the first instances of a company making changes in response to the rules, which went into effect last Friday, and an early victory for regulators. ADVERTISEMENT In the past, Sprint had throttled speeds for users consuming the most data at times when its network was congested. The company stopped doing so last Friday, the  Journal  reported. The carrier told the paper it believed it was already in compliance with the rules but that it had made the change as a precaution. The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) net neutrality rules apply to the wireless industry in addition to traditional broadband Internet service providers like Comcast. CTIA, a wireless trade association, is suing the federal government over the rules. The FCC has not moved to take action against any providers under the new rules yet, and commissioners say they are not sure how enforcement might play out. But Internet providers are now classified like utilities under the rules, giving the FCC more regulatory power. At least one company has also said it is likely to file a complaint against Time Warner Cable.
