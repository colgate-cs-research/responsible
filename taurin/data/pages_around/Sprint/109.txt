 QUINCY -- Two of the Quincy area's biggest internet providers -- Adams Fiber and Comcast -- say they have no plans to begin blocking, throttling or giving paid prioritization as a result of the "net neutrality" repeal by the Federal Communications Commission. When the FCC voted Dec. 14 to throw out the 2015 Open Internet Order, also known as net neutrality, many internet customers around the nation began bracing for the arrival of internet "fast lanes" and "slow lanes." The fear was that big companies, such as Amazon or YouTube, could be given faster access to users if they were willing to pay significant fees while other companies would have slower access if they didn't pay higher fees. In response to this development, Adams Fiber issued a notice reassuring its customers that it has no plans to change its approach to three core elements of net neutrality -- blocking, throttling and paid prioritization. "Adams has never done any of those things and repeal of the Open Internet Order will not change that," the statement said. "Our subscribers can rest assured that their experience with us will remain the same: an open and neutral connection to the Internet." Jim Broemmer, chief executive officer for Adams Fiber, told The Herald-Whig that "we're not looking to do any of those things that consumers are concerned about from an ISP (internet service provider) perspective." Broemmer said Adams Fiber's main business approach involves expanding its network of services to provide high-speed fiber internet connections to homes in 23 area communities, including Quincy. "I don't see us deviating from that traditional business approach," he said. "As a service provider enabling access to the internet, we're not looking to make any changes in how we approach providing services to our customers." Broemmer said Adams Fiber customers are eager to have faster internet services with plenty of bandwidth, which is why so many are signing up for high-speed fiber connections. "Our belief is the service that you pay for is what you should get," he said. Meanwhile, the Associated Press queried seven major internet providers -- Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, Charter, Cox, Sprint and T-Mobile -- about their post-net-neutrality plans, and all of them equivocated when asked if they might establish fast and slow lanes. None of the seven companies would rule out the possibility. Three said they had "no plans" for paid prioritization, and a few declined to answer the question at all. The Associated Press reported that Comcast officials said the company has "no plans" to create fast lanes and "will not" block or slow sites. In a Dec. 14 blog post, David Cohen, Comcast's senior executive vice president, said: "We will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content on the Internet; we will be fully transparent with respect to our practices; and we have not entered into any paid prioritization arrangements, and we have no plans to do so." Here's how the other wireless and cable companies responded to the AP's query: AT&T -- FAST LANES: No specific response -- BLOCK OR SLOW SITES: Says it "will not" do so THE WORDS: Spokesman Mike Balmoris didn't specifically answer when asked if AT&T will create fast lanes. In a Nov. 30 blog post , AT&T senior executive vice president Bob Quinn said: "We will not block websites, we will not throttle or degrade internet traffic based on content, and we will not unfairly discriminate in our treatment of internet traffic." VERIZON -- FAST LANES: No specific response -- BLOCK OR SLOW DOWN SITES: Says it doesn't do so, but declined to address the future THE WORDS: In a Nov. 21 statement , Verizon senior vice president Kathy Grillo said: "We continue to believe that users should be able to access the internet when, where, and how they choose, and our customers will continue to do so." Asked whether Verizon will continue not to block or throttle content or whether it will charge internet companies to get better access to customers, Young said Verizon "does not block or throttle content and that's the bottom line." CHARTER -- FAST LANES: Says there are no plans to create them -- BLOCK OR SLOW DOWN SITES: Says it doesn't do so and has "no plans" to change that THE WORDS: In a Dec. 14 blog post : "We don't slow down, block, or discriminate against lawful content. Simply put, we don't interfere with the lawful online practices of our customers and we have no plans to change our practices." COX -- FAST LANES: Does not plan to create them -- BLOCK OR SLOW DOWN SITES: Says it doesn't do so and has no plans to THE WORDS: In an emailed statement on Dec. 14: "We do not block, throttle or otherwise interfere with consumers' desire to go where they want on the Internet." A spokesman said the company has no plans to block or throttle content or enter into paid prioritization agreements. SPRINT -- FAST LANES: No specific response -- BLOCK OR SLOW DOWN SITES: Says it doesn't block sites, but didn't answer questions about the future THE WORDS: In a press release on Dec. 14, Sprint wrote: "Our position has been and continues to be that competition is the best way to promote an open internet." From its "open internet" website : "Sprint does not block sites based on content or subject." T-MOBILE -- FAST LANES: No response about future plans -- BLOCK OR SLOW DOWN SITES: No response about future plans THE WORDS: A company spokeswoman pointed to a February 2015 statement from T-Mobile CEO John Legere: "We have always believed in competition and in a free, open Internet with rules that protect net neutrality -- no blocking, no discrimination and transparency."
