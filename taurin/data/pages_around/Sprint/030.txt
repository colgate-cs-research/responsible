Sprint currently offers a number of tools and ways to assist customers with the management of their wireless bills and voice, data and text usage, including:

1000% on 25MB
500% on 50MB
300% on 75MB
200% on 100MB
100% on 250MB or 300MB
40% on 500MB-750MB
20% on 1GB-5GB
5% on 6GB-40GB


Usage reporting and usage alerts (for data and international) are provided at the time the information is received and processed by Sprint's billing system. This causes a delay that is normally minimal for on-network usage. However, the delay can be up to 60 days for off-network and international roaming due to reliance on records received from other carriers.

To set your usage alert preferences for email or text Log in to your account at http://mysprint.sprint.com, go to "My Preferences", and select "Email Notification" and then the "Security and Usage Notification" section to select Email or text messages. If no preference is selected, Sprint will use text messaging as the default for usage alerts.
