##METHOD: paragraphs

Update Hmmm, seems I should have looked further into OpenWeb. One of our readers wrote in and pointed me to a TreoCentral Forum thread in which this OpenWeb is discussed. And these folks aren't at all happy with what's been going on lately. Here's a quote from the email I received:
Go read that thread that I linked above. From what I've read, this doesn't sound too good afterall. But hopefully things will get ironed out before Sprint actually rolls out OpenWeb.
From the article:
With Openwave OpenWeb, the Web sites that Sprint customers visit on their mobile phones will automatically appear on data-enabled Sprint phones in an easy-to-read format that's closer to a desktop experience of the Internet, regardless of the memory or processing power of the device.  Wow, that sure sounds great! And brings to mind Apple's Safari. It's just a matter of time before other companies catch up with Apple and have a beautiful Web browser on their devices. And if one comes out that looks better than Safari, I think I'll pass out! 
The Openwave OpenWeb will be available nationwide in the coming weeks, and this enhancement follows Sprint's launch of a more user-friendly mobile search product, Microsoft's enhanced Live Search for mobile, in 2007.
The article also reports that Sprint plans to launch additional mobile Web innovations in 2008 that will further enhance usersÂ experience on their mobile device. To access the mobile Web, customers should click on the Web icon on their phoneÂs main menu. Hmmm, sounds great and I'm sure all you Centro, Treo 755p, and Treo 700wx users are excited about this.
Here's a PDF that tells about OpenWeb, explaining exactly what it is and how it works. Interesting stuff.
