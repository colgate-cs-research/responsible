##TITLE: Sprint : Statement on FCC Open Internet Order | MarketScreener
##METHOD: paragraphs



      Sprint has been a leader in supporting an open Internet and commends the FCC for its hard work in arriving at a thoughtful, measured approach on this important issue.  We believe balanced net neutrality rules with a light regulatory touch will benefit consumers, while fostering mobile broadband competition, investment and innovation in the United States.  We look forward to reviewing the FCC order and continuing to work with policymakers to ensure consumers benefit from an open Internet.
