"Some ISPs, including MVPDs and wireless providers, have initiated bandwidth caps or 
      usage-based price tiers, using a variety of business models. During the first half of 2012, most major 
      MSOs formalized bandwidth caps or usage-based/metered pricing. They generally adopted thresholds 
      that exceed typical traffic and chose either to cap usage or to implement overage charges for customers
      who exceed the limits.

The Commission acknowledged in its 2015 Open Internet Order that zero-rating-based business models may, in some instances, provide consumer and competitive benefits. [OI 2015 para 151] These benefits may include increased video competition by facilitating the availability of over-the-top (OTT) offerings. Rather than a per se approach, the Commission explained that it would “look at and assess such practices under the no-unreasonable interference/disadvantage standard, based on the facts of each individual case, and take action as necessary.”	 [OI 2015 para 133-153]...
“Zero-rated” content, applications, and services are those that end users can access without the data consumed being counted toward the usage allowances or data caps imposed by an operator’s service plans. Thus, for example, if a consumer has subscribed to a broadband service plan that allows usage of 10 gigabytes of data per month, but then uses more than 10 gigabytes of cellular data5 in a given month, the provider may impose surcharges for excess data usage or may reduce the consumer’s data usage to a slower speed for the remainder of that monthly billing cycle. That consumer’s use of data to access zero-rated edge services, however, does not count toward her monthly data usage allowance under her mobile broadband service plan. A zero-rated edge service therefore becomes inherently more attractive to the consumer as compared to a non-zero-rated service, other factors held constant, because it costs less.
Some mobile broadband providers offer “sponsored data” arrangements to edge providers that seek to provide their services on a zero-rated basis. Under these arrangements, edge providers offer their services to consumers on a zero-rated basis by arranging to “buy down,” or “sponsor,” the data these consumers use. This enables consumers to utilize those edge services without worrying that such usage could cause them to exceed the applicable data allowances under their broadband providers’ service plans.

"At this time, AT&Ts Data Perks appears to be designed for use primarily by marketing firms and advertisers seeking to entice consumers to view their online ads or interact with their marketing apps by offering free data to those consumers for use with any content of the consumers choosing. Data Perks also can be used to enable marketers to deliver content or applications to consumers effectively on a zero-rated basis  i.e., to let consumers view their ads or download their games, surveys, or other apps, without affecting their monthly data usage allowances.
"Based on information we have on Data Perks, we believe it is not likely that this program unreasonably interferes with or disadvantages any edge providers or end users ability to use the Internet to reach one another. As an initial matter, Data Perks benefits consumers by allowing them to get additional data to use for whatever purpose they choose. Additionally, based on the information we have, it appears that most Data Perks participants are not marketing services that run over BIAS. Also, providers have other avenues through which to advertise to consumers. Moreover, we are not aware of any Data Perks participants who use the Data Perks app to provide services that compete with AT&T or AT&T affiliates at this time. Importantly, Data Perks, as a marketing device, seems to be designed for zero-rating small amounts of data. 
"AT&Ts Sponsored Data program is designed to enable third party edge providers to deliver streaming edge content on a zero-rated basis to AT&Ts mobile broadband subscribers. [The FCC has] serious concerns that AT&T Mobilitys Sponsored Data program presents competitive problems and, to date, nothing in AT&T responses to the Bureaus requests for information has addressed our concerns. Based on the information gathered to date, we believe there is a substantial possibility that some of AT&Ts practices may violate the General Conduct Rule.
.....
Our concerns about the potentially anticompetitive impact of AT&Ts conduct are based in part, but not entirely, on the fact that unaffiliated mobile video service providers must pay a significant, clearly identifiable amount of money for the sponsored data needed to offer streaming video programming to AT&T Mobilitys subscribers on a zero-rated basis  by comparison to AT&T, which need not incur a comparable out-of-pocket expenditure to offer DIRECTV Now on a zero-rated basis. Rather, any imputed charges that DIRECTV pays AT&T Mobility for sponsored data, even if formally recorded on the corporate books as internal transfer payments, would result in no net expenditure at the holding company level.
AT&T Mobilitys treatment of unaffiliated edge providers is therefore materially different in its effect from its treatment of its corporate affiliate; but that difference is not necessarily unreasonable if it does not unreasonably disadvantage those unaffiliated parties. For instance, the overall arrangement could comply with the General Conduct Rule if the unaffiliated edge providers out-of-pocket expenditure per gigabyte of sponsored data was consistent with the economic cost, expressed on a per-gigabyte basis, of supplying the AT&T Mobility data used to offer DIRECTV Now service on a zero-rated basis. That cost of course is not zero; as the 2015 Open Internet Order recognized, broadband providers must make necessary returns on their substantial capital investments to construct, maintain, and improve their networks, as well as incurring significant operating expenses.65 We lack the information at this time, however, needed to assess whether AT&Ts current sponsored data price to third party providers  which we have estimated could be $5/GB based on AT&Ts reference to wholesale market pricing as an appropriate benchmark  is reasonable under this standard.66 Given that vast quantities of data are transmitted over AT&Ts network and that the incremental cost of data transmitted under its networks peak capacity is close to zero, we would expect that per-gigabyte amount, though non-zero, to be quite low  and in all likelihood lower than the wholesale rates AT&T currently charges to wireless resellers.
In light of the rates at which DIRECTV is offering its DIRECTV Now service to end users, the information we have indicates that AT&T (including both the network operator and edge provider affiliates) does not consider zero-rating to be a real cost of business. Instead, AT&T appears to view the network cost of Sponsored Data for DIRECTV Now as effectively de minimis. Unlike T-Mobile, however, which charges all edge providers the same zero rate for participating in Binge On, AT&T imposes hefty per-gigabyte charges on unaffiliated third parties for use of Sponsored Data. All indications are that AT&Ts charges far exceed the costs AT&T incurs in providing the sponsored data service. Thus, it would appear that AT&Ts practices inflict significant unreasonable disadvantages on edge providers and unreasonably interfere with their ability to compete against AT&Ts affiliate, in violation of the General Conduct Rule. 
AT&T Mobility, LLC, Notice of Apparently Liability, File No. EB-IHD-14-00017504 (June 17, 2015) (fining AT&T Mobility for failure to disclose throttling of "unlimited" data plans); AT&T Mobility Faces $100M Fine for Misleading Consumers, FCC Press Release, Jun 17, 2015.
Authority: Open Internet Transparency Rule 2010 
Finding: "we find that AT&T apparently willfully and repeatedly violated Section 8.3 of the Commissions Rules by: (1) using the term unlimited in a misleading and inaccurate way to label a data plan that was in fact subject to prolonged speed reductions after a customer used a set amount of data; and (2) failing to disclose the data throughput speed caps it imposed on customers under the MBR policy. Para. 17.
Enforcement: Forfeiture $100,000,000
Facts: "In 2007, AT&T began offering unlimited data plans, which allowed customers to use unrestricted amounts of data, with no high-speed data caps or automatic speed restrictions. AT&T ceased offering these unlimited plans to new customers in 2010, but continues to allow grandfathered customers on unlimited data plans to renew their plans on a month-to-month or term basis. Para. 7
In 2011, AT&T implemented its Maximum Bit Rate (MBR) policy, under which the Company capped the maximum speed throughput that unlimited data plan customers experienced once they used a set amount of data in a billing cycle. Para. 8. According to AT&T, unlimited data plan customers were notified about the MBR policy through various means, including [a press release (archived copy), a 2011 bill insert, a webpage (archived Feb. 10, 2012), point of sale information, and provisions of AT&Ts service contract]. Para. 14.
Analysis: The imposition of set data thresholds and speed reductions is antithetical to the term unlimited. AT&T was aware that its continued use of the word unlimited to describe its data plans was likely to mislead consumers. Para. 19. Consumers entered into contracts for these unlimited plans with the mistaken belief that they had unlimited amounts of high speed data sufficient to use any website or application. Para 20. 
 Under the 2010 Transparency Rule, broadband providers are expected to disclose the expected and actual access speed of their services.  AT&T's notice to customers was insufficient. Information about these specific limitations was never available on AT&Ts Broadband Information Disclosure webpage. AT&T also did not disclose any information about the magnitude of the speed reductions. Para. 22.  A 2011 press release did not provide notice to subsequent customers. Email and text notices were sent only to the heaviest users and sent once. AT&T's link to its "broadband information webpage" gave no indication why a customer would want to visit the webpage and provides no information about the MBR policy.  The language in the service contract is vague and insufficient. Vague disclosures are not an adequate substitute for fully explaining the MBR policy. Paras. 27-29.
 FTC Proceeding Tracker
See FTC v. AT&T Mobility 9th Cir. (holding FTC has jurisdiction over AT&T Mobility)
 FTC v ATT Mobility, 87 F. Supp. 3d 1087 NDCA March 31, 2015
The Federal Trade Commission filed suit against AT&T Mobility LLC, asserting that AT&T engaged in acts or practices, in connection with the marketing of mobile data services, that violate 15 U.S.C. § 45(a). In 2007, AT&T was the exclusive mobile data provider for the Apple iPhone. Initially, AT&T offered iPhone customers an unlimited mobile data plan. In 2010, AT&T stopped offering the unlimited mobile data plan to new smartphone customers Old customers, however, were grandfathered  in essence, to ensure that they would not switch mobile data providers. In July 2011, AT&T decided to begin reducing the data speed for unlimited mobile data plan customers, a practice commonly known as data throttling. . Disclosures about the throttling program have been limited and not adequate the FTC has brought two claims pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 45(a) which prohibits, inter alia, unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.  the gravamen of the FTCs complaint is not AT&Ts practice of throttling per se, but AT&Ts deceptive conduct in failing to disclose its throttling to certain customers.

First introduced in November 2015, T-Mobile’s “Binge On” is a zero-rated service for streaming video services that meet certain technical standards. Participating edge providers can offer to T-Mobile’s mobile broadband subscribers zero- rated video programming at 1.5 Mbps or 480p+/DVD quality – comparable to standard definition (SD), not high definition (HD), television format. During the course of the FCC's review of Binge On, T-Mobile did not compel edge providers or consumers to participate in Binge On, and did not charge them anything if they opt to do so...
From the consumer’s side, T-Mobile subscribers can easily enable or disable Binge On from their user settings and opt-out or opt-in to zero-rating as they choose.47 Although T-Mobile does establish technical standards governing video transmissions for edge providers who wish to participate in Binge On, it appears that many edge providers have been able to meet these technical criteria, with T-Mobile announcing that over 100 edge providers were participating in Binge On as of July 26, 2016.48 Given these facts, we find it difficult to envision that Binge On in the form the Bureau reviewed in 2016 could “unreasonably interfere with edge providers’ ability to make lawful content, applications, services, or devices available to end users.”
Moreover, T-Mobile provides little streaming video programming of its own at present, and while it (or affiliated entities) might seek to more fully establish affiliated content arrangements in the future, for now T-Mobile does not compete substantially with downstream edge providers that supply video programming using Binge On (such as, for example, DIRECTV Now).50 Accordingly, T-Mobile is not likely to have strong incentives to “unreasonably disadvantage” unaffiliated edge providers, and we are not aware of any evidence that it is doing so. Finally, T-Mobile charges all edge provider participants an identical zero price and, so far as we are aware, has uniform technical requirements for all interested edge providers that numerous providers have been able to meet. Binge On thus appears not to discriminate against or disadvantage (much less unreasonably discriminate or unreasonably disadvantage) any edge provider or end user.

"The structure of Verizon Wirelesss FreeBee Data 360 sponsored data program offering may pose concerns for the same reasons as AT&Ts Sponsored Data program discussed above, given the contrast between the manner in which it supplies the platform for the zero-rating activities of third-parties as compared with the manner in which it offers its own zero-rated go90 service. [The FCC is]  aware of no safeguards that would prevent Verizon from offering substantially more costly or restrictive terms to enable unaffiliated edge providers to offer services comparable to Verizons go90 on a zero-rated basis. And we have no data to confirm Verizons unsupported assertion, submitted as part of its response to our request for information, that the FreeBee Data 360 sponsored data program offers third parties prices and terms equivalent to the economic net cost by Verizon to zero-rate its affiliated go90 video service. 
Major wireless providers also have begun to impose data caps.935 For example, in July 
          2012, both AT&T and Verizon Wireless announced plans to facilitate customers' sharing of data across 
          smartphones, tablets, and other devices.936 The new shared data plans charge a monthly fee for each 
          device and then charge for a shared pool of monthly data transfer ranging from 1 GB to 20 GB.937 Early 
          evidence suggests that consumers materially increase their data consumption when upgrading to Long 
          Term Evolution ("LTE") devices.938
