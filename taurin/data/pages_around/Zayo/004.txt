Colorado Tech Weekly brings you the top 10  technology stories of the past week and the best upcoming local tech events every Monday morning!
This week representatives talk about net neutrality which is vital to the tech industry. There’s also an event about art and tech which are both industries that take creativity and persistence. And I get to toot my own horn and share news about my company, Infinicept. It’s nice to make AND share tech news.
Have a great week!
