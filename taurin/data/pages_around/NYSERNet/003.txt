The Association of Research Libraries (ARL), EDUCAUSE, Internet2, NYSERNet and ACUTA have published comments, welcoming an initiative to preserve the openness of the Internet. The comments are part of a joint filing to the US’ Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the Net Neutrality proceedings. 

The non-profit organisations ARL, EDUCAUSE and Internet2 have expressed support for the codification of the six principles outlined in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). They have also urged the FCC to adopt clear, enforceable rules to preserve the openness of the Internet as soon as possible. ARL and EDUCAUSE - both members of the Open Internet Coalition – have also endorsed the Coalition’s comments in this proceeding.

According to the organisations, research libraries and higher education institutions rely on an open Internet to collaborate and to obtain important services and content from outside sources. It is expected that neutrality rules would preserve the benefits that flow from the Internet’s open, democratic nature. By keeping broadband providers from raising artificial price barriers and stifling open debate, Net neutrality would preserve the principles that have made the Internet a competitive market for ideas as well as goods and services.
