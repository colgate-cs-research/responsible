 It's interesting to compare sponsored data with 800 telephone numbers where the owner of the 800 number pays the long distance charge. I think sponsored data COULD be considered the equivalent of an 800 number. If it were offered on an equal basis to all content providers, it seems that it could be fair. The real issue here is that ATT is both a communications carrier AND a content provider, so there may be some cross subsidy. In the old days, there was a very clear separation between communications services and other services (the big thing at that time was computer services). Now, communications companies are offering content, so it may be difficult to divide costs correctly. However, I think 800 numbers are a good idea, and a fairly applied Internet equivalent could also be a good idea.
