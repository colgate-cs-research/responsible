 It’s Net Neutrality Day 
 Posted on  July 12, 2017      by    Les Sinclair 
 
 Net neutrality  is the principle that Internet service providers like Comcast,  Verizon, AT&T, should not control what we see and do online. In 2015, users won strong net neutrality rules from the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC). The rules prohibit Internet providers from blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization—”fast lanes” for sites that pay, and slow lanes for everyone else. 
 The FCC is now considering rescinding those benefits.
