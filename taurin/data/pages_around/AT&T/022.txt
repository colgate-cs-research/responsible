 The FCC’s approval of AT&T’s acquisition of BellSouth has reinvigorated net neutrality proponents, who believe that ISPs must treat all Internet content equally. To earn the FCC’s blessing over the merger, AT&T had to promise that it would not prioritize the bits and bytes passing over its network, according to  Ars Technica .  In early 2006, telecom companies began threatening, essentially, to charge Internet content providers premiums depending on the amount of bandwidth their content required, so AT&T’s vow to treat Internet content equally represents a dramatic shift for the company. Consumer and net neutrality advocates hope AT&T’s 180 will lead Congress to pass legislation preventing ISPs from controlling which content gets priority over their networks.  Related Links:
