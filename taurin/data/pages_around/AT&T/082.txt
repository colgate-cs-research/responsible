 I remember the Indian regulator banned Facebook’s ‘Free Basics’ program (essentially 100% subsidised use of a basic Facebook app) on net neutrality grounds.  This made no sense to me – if Facebook is willing to pay for consumers’ data then surely that’s good for the consumer, so why should the regulator stop them?  The argument seems to be that small competitors couldn’t afford to match Facebook’s offer, so would therefore be at an ‘unfair’ disadvantage.  But is it really unfair if Facebook decides to spend its marketing dollars in this way?  Should we therefore ban Facebook from spending any marketing dollars at all, because small competitors would be at a disadvantage?  Consumers end up having to pay the maximum price for data because nobody is allowed to subsidise it.  The point of net neutrality is not to dictate how marketing budgets are spent, and the point of regulation is not to disadvantage consumers.

 Which of the following would be the best long-term household broadband solution? 
   It's got to be fibre (FTTH, FTTP, FTTx, etc.) 
   Fixed wireless access based on 5G will rival the best fibre can offer 
   Cable and copper are here to stay for a long time
