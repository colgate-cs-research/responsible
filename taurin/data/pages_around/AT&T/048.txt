##METHOD: paragraphs

Net neutrality, sometimes called Internet Freedom, is the idea that your internet service provider (ISP) should treat all websites the same. ISPs like AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast want to treat them differently so they can charge for access.

					 On December 14, 2017 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is planning to eliminate net neutrality rules, effectively allowing ISPs to become the gatekeepers of the Internet and making it legal for them to block websites and services.

ISPs provide you internet access. You can use it as much as you want, for anything you want.
All your data goes through a single connection and youâre charged one monthly fee.
ISPs want to manage internet access and charge you depending on your usage.
That means AT&T or Comcast could block a service like Google Maps and charge for their own.
