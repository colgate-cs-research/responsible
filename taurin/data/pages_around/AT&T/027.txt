Shocker: AT&T’s CEO Tells the Truth About Net Neutrality Dana Floberg Feb 15, 2019 · 3 min read Skip Navigation For years, big telecom companies like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon have had their armies of lobbyists swarming the FCC and Congress to spread lies about Net Neutrality. In particular, they like to claim that by adopting strong Net Neutrality rules in 2015 and basing them on Title II of the Communications Act, the FCC somehow created a regulatory burden that harmed broadband investment. Of course, that claim is absolutely   false. The numbers show that investment by the internet service providers that report such things has  actually increased  by  about 5 percent  in the two years since Net Neutrality became the law of the land. We’ve written before ( many ,  many   times ) about how the lobbyists and hired guns for these big ISPs are lying when they blame this nonexistent slump in investment on Net Neutrality rules and the laws that support them. But the aggregate total for investment is just a small part of the story, and not a terribly important part. If you want to know the truth about why any particular ISP increased or decreased its individual investments over the years, you just have to ask them. And that’s exactly what real investment analysts do. All you have to do is  read the transcripts  from  these investor conferences  to see the real reasons for AT&T’s temporary dip in investment in 2015. Free Press Policy Director Matt Wood took to Twitter on Friday to call out AT&T for its double-talk — and he came with receipts: In today’s  @MikeSnider   @usatoday  piece, here’s what  @ATTPublicPolicy  CEO Randall Stephenson said, lying about  #TitleII .  #NetNeutrality   pic.twitter.com/Z0QujYAL6Z — Matt Wood (@mattfwood)  May 5, 2017 But whoops! What did that very same guy tell investors in December 2015 about AT&T’s investments? Is this a  #TitleII  thing?  #NetNeutrality   pic.twitter.com/3B6ct6gvsA — Matt Wood (@mattfwood)  May 5, 2017 Whoops, part 2. Tell us,  @ATTPublicPolicy , ws it  #TitleII  that dropped your investment in 2015? No, you say? Hmm.  #NetNeutrality   pic.twitter.com/KF0ZhmcKEf — Matt Wood (@mattfwood)  May 5, 2017 Whoops, part 3. Wouldn’t you be spending a lot more on wireless without  #TitleII , Randall? No?!?  #NetNeutrality   pic.twitter.com/RgYZrVMD5P — Matt Wood (@mattfwood)  May 5, 2017 But surely you have to spend more on your wired networks, or else  #TitleII  is a big old flop. Right??  #NetNeutrality   pic.twitter.com/dp7uJuEFh0 — Matt Wood (@mattfwood)  May 5, 2017 Come on, Randall! You told reporters  #TitleII  makes you deploy less, but really you’re building *more* & just spending less??  #NetNeutrality   pic.twitter.com/p4xFbZGh7b — Matt Wood (@mattfwood)  May 5, 2017 I’m a little slow. You mean with all that spectrum & networks you already have, it’s NOT  #TitleII  driving your investment??  #NetNeutrality   pic.twitter.com/fYZPfmjIAM — Matt Wood (@mattfwood)  May 5, 2017 So sum it up for me, Randall.  #TitleII  and  #NetNeutrality  are killing you, right? Huge burden. Apocalyptic impact. Right?  pic.twitter.com/rXSQnPkMkT — Matt Wood (@mattfwood)  May 5, 2017 Will  @AjitPaiFCC ,  @HalSinger ,  @USTelecom ,  @JSpalter  or  @FSFthinktank  stop telling the lies they tell about AT&T and  #TitleII ? Probably not. — Matt Wood (@mattfwood)  May 5, 2017 But for anyone who cares, the truth is plain to see.  @MikeSnider   @margarethmcgill   @makejdm   @maggie_reardon   @dmccabe   @b_fung   @ceciliakang — Matt Wood (@mattfwood)  May 5, 2017 Originally published at  www.freepress.net .
