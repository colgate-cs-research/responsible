 Singapore Exchange-listed YuuZoo has signed an agreement to be the exclusive social broadcasting partner of Australia-based X-Cast in Asia. Through the tie-up, YuuZoo users will be able to watch exclusive performances by their favorite DJ's and artists. Through its proprietary payment platform YuuPay, YuuZoo will also manage all payments for pay-per-view events (PPV) globally for X-Cast. YuuZoo users will receive a notification when their chosen entertainers or favorite channels are on live broadcast or streaming. They can also access exclusive content across multiple devices including smartphones. In addition to live events, YuuZoo also gets exclusive rights to broadcast 40 top US channels including RushTV from Redbull, Eurochannels and Tuff TV. “This partnership will generate revenue in the form of advertising and payments through PPV videos and live streaming events,” said Thomas Zilliacus chairman and CEO of YuuZoo. “X-Cast will use our proprietary payment platform YuuPay for all payments worldwide.” Ron Creevey, founder and CEO of X-Cast, said the company estimates that payments for PPV events globally for X-Cast will reach at least $20 million a year.
