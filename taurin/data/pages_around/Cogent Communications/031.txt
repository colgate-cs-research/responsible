 FCC Votes to Preserve and Protect the Open Internet with Title II Regulation   
 WASHINGTON, D.C. February 26, 2015 – Today the Federal Communications Commission, under Chairman Tom Wheeler's leadership, voted to preserve and protect the open Internet by prohibiting blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization in the provision of Internet service to consumers. The Commission has adopted a common sense set of rules that will allow the virtuous cycle of innovation that has characterized the Internet to continue. 
 These rules will allow Cogent and others to continue to invest in the Internet, improve its quality and capacity, and drive down its cost. Addressing interconnection and other practices on a case-by-case basis will permit the Commission to protect consumers without adopting burdensome regulations. Cogent looks forward to Commission action to remedy the throttling by broadband Internet providers of Internet content requested by their consumers by refusing to provide sufficient capacity at points of interconnection with the rest of the Internet.
