 AT&T, I encourage you to think this one through a little more, I understand how tempting it may be to side with Comcast given you both have control over so many of the internet subscribers in the USA. 
 Comcast has the privelidge of exclusive control of their end users and as such has a responsibility to ensure fair and equal access is maintained between its subscribers and the services they wish to access. 
 Their recent actions are tantamount to an abuse of position, I for one am reconsidering if I want to maintain my Comcast service. I could move to U-verse of course.

 I think the last one that should be commenting on this is AT&T. Over the years AT&T has consistently undermined and stifled competition and innovation in the telecommunications world. It has proven time and time again that it is only interested in serving itself. AT&T clearly sees an opportunity here.

 Bob, if you could read the Free Press page to which you link, they didn’t “shout” net neutrality violation.  Level 3 sure portrayed it as such, and some early releases from groups like mine issued statements based on L3’s claim.  But after more if the facts came to light, we realized this might just be plain old anti-competitive behavior without a per se net neutrality angle.  Tim Karr’s piece is careful about this nuance, as was everything else I saw from Free Press.

 @Alex Rodriquez: Agreed. I was even linked here through an ad on another site. What company advertises its blog posts if it is not pushing an agenda? This just smells fishy. 
 I’m wagging my finger back and forth at you AT&T and Comcast. You are both very, very bad men.

 @Alex Rodriguez & Babe Ruth. 
 AT&T has changed alot in the past decade. In commenting on the high price of wireless data plans, at&t responded that eventually “voice, text… it will all be data” (wish I could find a link), and recently suggested that they wanted to replace their legacy circut switched landline telephone networks with packet switched networks. 
 Let’s see the likes of Verizon or Comcast say the same. In particular, Verizon recently went through a “accidental” data charge scandle, and not too long ago tried to sue Vonage out of existance.

 For years, when Free Press has used the term toll lanes or toll booths on the Internet, it has been in the context of a call to action on why it thinks the United States needs its peculiar version of net neutrality.  Here are just a few references dating from 2006 and at various points in the past year where FreePress uses that term to denote its version of violations of “real” net neutrality: ( http://www.freepress.net/news/17463 ;  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-tady/mere-hours-left-to-save-n_b_796497.html ;  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-aaron/google-verizon-pact-it-ge_b_676194.html ;  http://www.savetheinternet.com/fcc-comments )  This list is not exhaustive.  I just stopped at the top few search results on the topic.  Matt, no reasonable person could read the nuance you claim is in the Tim Karr post given that history.  But, if Free Press and MAP are now saying that you all think Level 3 is wrong to call this dustup a net neutrality violation, you should say that.  I couldn’t agree more!
