 Regional endpoints Network neutralitymost commonly called net neutralityis the principle that Internet service providers ISPs must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on usercontentwebsiteplatformapplicationtype of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication. 
 With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally blockslow downor charge money for specific online content. Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block traffic from specific services, while charging consumers for various tiers of service. The term was coined by Columbia Service locations cogent communications media law professor Tim Wu inas an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrierwhich was used to describe the role of telephone systems. Research suggests that a combination of policy instruments will help realize the range of valued political and economic objectives central to the network neutrality debate. Proponents of net neutrality, which service locations cogent communications computer science experts, consumer advocateshuman rights organizationsand Internet content providers, assert that net neutrality helps to provide freedom of information exchange, promotes competition and innovation for Internet services, and upholds standardization of Internet data transmission which was essential for its growth. 
 Opponents of net neutrality, which include ISPs, and telecom equipment manufacturers, argue that net neutrality requirements would reduce their incentive to build out the Internet, reduces competition in the marketplace, and may raise their operating costs which they would have to pass along to their users. Net neutrality is administered on a national or regional basis, though much of the world's focus has been on the conflict over net neutrality in the United States. Net neutrality in the US has been a topic since the early s, as they were one of the world leaders in online service providing. How it Works: Inthe Save the Internet Act to "guarantee broadband internet users equal access to online content" was passed by the United States House of Representatives [14] but not by the US Senate.

Proponents argue that this could cause an increase in monetary charges for companies such as Netflix in order to stream their content. 
 Under an "open Internet" system, the full resources of the Internet and means to operate on it should be easily accessible to all individuals, companies, and communicafions. Applicable concepts include: net neutrality, open standardstransparencylack of Internet censorshipand low barriers to entry. The cgent of the open Internet is sometimes expressed as an expectation of decentralized technological powerand is seen by some observers as closely related to open-source softwarea type of  learn more here  program whose maker allows users access to the code that runs the program, so that users can improve the software or fix bugs. 
 Proponents of net neutrality see this as an important component of an "open Internet", wherein policies such as equal treatment of data and open web standards allow those using the Internet to easily communicate, and conduct service locations cogent communications and activities without service locations cogent communications from a third party. In contrast, a "closed Internet" refers to the opposite situation, wherein established persons, corporations, or governments favor certain uses, restrict access to necessary web standardsartificially degrade some services, or explicitly filter out content. In comparison to the United States or Canada for example, these countries have far more restrictive internet service providers.]
