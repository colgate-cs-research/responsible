Because so many people now have to remotely connect to their workplace (I've gone from 10 remote users a day to 55), some ISPs are offering a temporary speed bump to help their customers out.
As a account manager for Cogent, I know that some sales people sometimes aren't the best listeners! We will sometimes make assumptions that we know best, when the reality is no one knows your network better than the folks that manage it daily. I want to get some true feedback from folks in the trenches, no worries I wont reach out to sell you unless you request me to! But it would be helpful to know what you as a customer and end user is looking for in an ISP to partner with!
I look for GOOD/efficient support, speed, and reliability.
If the internet is down, I need to talk to someone ASAP. I'd rather not spend 10 minutes in a phone tree, wait on hold for 30 minutes for the next representative who is "anxious to help", and then have the representative talk to me as if I've never heard of the term "modem" before.
We use a local ISP who in my opinion is VERY good. They offer a commercial grade cable with exceptional support. I call a commercial support number, get no phone tree, and within 5 minutes I'm on the line with someone who's in the building a few blocks down the street who knows who I am and what I'm capable of. I can also send one of my account managers an e-mail if I have any questions/concerns. Best part ,they're here to investigate an issue within an hour. When I worked with Comcast and Verizon, they would plan something for the next day, only to have the technician not show up and cause additional problems. I'll call back and it's like if I never spoke to them before. Terrible!
Honestly, the last thing I look at is the price. Good support, speed, and reliability is priceless. This is the backbone of every business so price should not be a factor in something as critical as this. No internet, the entire business is down. Worth the investment.
My 2 cents.
Hey George, Welcome to Spice Community!  Good to have our ISP/Carrier partners represented on Spice.       


Most of our SpiceHead and other clients come to us looking for ISP reviews or negotiated pricing with PRICE as the lead factor. It's certainly one very important aspect (and Cogent can often be the price leader when on net) - but as will be described here, there are many factors to consider when choosing an ISP.  And all will vary based on what is important to the end user, and the applications and design of the network (MPLS, VoIP, etc.).


﻿﻿Great first post, and we're certainly interested in following this thread.

WASHINGTON, D.C. March 21, 2014 – Today, Cogent Communications Group, Inc. CEO Dave Schaeffer offered to resolve the impasse between Cogent and major telephone and cable companies (Verizon, Comcast, AT&T, and Time Warner Cable) over upgrading the connections necessary to exchange Internet traffic, including streaming video traffic like Netflix, by paying the capital cost required for these companies to upgrade the connections (as well as Cogent's own costs) to ensure adequate capacity to deliver quality service to the customers of Cogent and these ISPs that have refused to upgrade traffic exchange capacity. Schaeffer said that for over a year customers of these ISPs have been suffering from the bottleneck imposed by these carriers.
"Cogent believes the traditional Internet model in which each party bears its own capital costs to upgrade an interconnection should be the model for these relationships but the reality of the gatekeeper power exercised by these telephone and cable companies requires that Cogent accept these additional costs in order to provide the highest quality Internet service possible," said Schaeffer.
To be clear, Cogent is not offering to enter into paid peering arrangements with these or any other networks. Rather, Cogent is simply willing, at this time, to incur the capital costs associated with augmenting its interconnections with these networks to address the current level of traffic congestion. Cogent believes that these major telephone and cable companies are attempting to leverage their monopoly on broadband residential Internet connections to increase their profits by imposing tolls on traffic requested by their customers and delivered by other Internet service providers.
Cogent believes that Title II classification is the optimal regulatory path to eliminate these tolls and preserve the open Internet. In the meantime, Cogent supports the FCC's effort to enforce and enhance the FCC's transparency rules and today submitted comments to the FCC in which Cogent offered concrete proposals that would advance the goals of the FCC's Open Internet Order. Cogent looks forward to continuing conversations with the FCC and the Internet community on these proposals and on the best ways to preserve a robust, innovative and truly open Internet.

WASHINGTON, D.C. February 26, 2014 – Cogent Communications Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CCOI) today announced that it is launching a new Channel Partner Program that will focus on relationships with national telecommunications master agents. Cogent sees substantial value in supplementing its direct sales efforts through the channel, recognizing that many enterprise customers purchase their Internet access and Ethernet transport through a trusted advisor such as a value-added reseller (VAR) or Agent.
"Cogent will methodically roll out its channel program beginning with 4-5 master agents in 2014," said Mike Kopp, Director of Partner Channel at Cogent. "Our goal is to build a solid foundation for the channel with competitive compensation and a simple contract, as well as rules of engagement and procedures that make sense. Cogent's product portfolio is not complicated, making it easy to do business with us."
Cogent is investing in the channel with dedicated resources that will assist partners from quote to close, including a new partner portal and a dedicated, experienced team to run the program. The initial beta launch will include two notable master agents, WTG and AB&T Telecom.
"As a long-standing, top-performing Cogent agent, we are elated with the new experienced, channel-friendly leadership, compensation and evergreen structure. We expect to truly define success with a leader in 'big bandwidth' for our Agent & VAR partner arsenal," said Vince Bradley, CEO of WTG. "Exciting times are ahead for all of us as cloud computing is now so prevalent. Speed will be extremely important as cloud-based services continue to grow. With Cogent's excellent backbone ranking, they will help us get there faster and within budget."
"Cogent is recognized as a disruptive price and performance leader in high speed bandwidth and that fits well with the demanding price sensitivity of our VAR and Agent channel customers," said Emmet Tydings, President of AB&T Telecom. "AB&T is familiar with and confident in the seasoned channel sales team that is launching the new Cogent Channel Partner Program, and we are psyched to be a part of it."
