Mark Zuckerberg is undoubtedly one you should idolize in case you have dreams like him. The CEO of Facebook is one of the youngest CEOs as well as a billionaire himself. The success story of Zuckerberg is not unknown to many and now Mark wants others to take on their dreams just like him. According to the reports, Mark Zuckerberg has stated that he wants to more students from the American High Schools to take up technology as their preferred subject for higher education.
Mark Zuckerberg has said long before that technology is going to develop to a much greater extent in the coming years. Thus he thinks that if the students are ready to toil hard and choose technology as the preferred subject for their higher education, their future will end up as a rather bright one. According to the words of Mark Zuckerberg at the Sequoia High School of Redwood City, the knowledge of computers and technology will open the floodgates for all the students
Facebook CEO donated 50 laptops to the students of Sequoia High School of Redwood City and has also announced that the social networking giant will be conducting classes where the students will learn about the fast developing technology and how to create applications for various smartphones. The event at Sequoia High School in Redwood City is a part of the companyâs plan to stir in enthusiasm among the youngsters to take on careers in computers and technology. The CEO of Facebook even told that this generation could easily produce more Zuckerbergs like him.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 A revolutionary mobile health platform for secure and critical communication 
LEWISVILLE, TX and CINCINNATI, OH — September 16, 2014 — American Messaging Services, LLC (“American Messaging”), the most trusted provider of critical messaging services in the United States and Doc Halo, LLC (“Doc Halo”), a pioneer in secure healthcare communications, are pleased to announce they have agreed to a strategic partnership to improve healthcare communication.
Reflecting a shared vision, the two companies have entered into a bi-directional revenue sharing agreement in which each company will benefit from their individual and collective efforts. American Messaging will also acquire a 25 percent equity interest in Doc Halo, the proceeds of which will be used to finance growth and continued product development.
The companies' combined customer base of more than 500,000 medical professionals and over 1,300 hospitals will now have immediate access to state-of-the-art technology that includes mobile applications and a mobile health platform for secure and critical communication. The partnership will now deliver a comprehensive suite of healthcare communication products and services that address the mobile health, secure communication and critical messaging needs of healthcare organizations throughout the United States.
J. Roy Pottle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of American Messaging said, “The growth in smart phones and more recent changes to the American Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), particularly the creation of more rigorous standards related to protected health information represent a meaningful opportunity for American Messaging to leverage its strengths as a critical messaging company. To do so we chose to partner with Doc Halo due to the quality of their secure messaging application but most importantly due to the domain expertise of their executive team. Dr. Jose Barreau and Dr. Amit Gupta, both highly respected oncologists, have a deep understanding of what is needed to ultimately improve patient care through secure and collaborative software applications — that understanding is clearly evident in Doc Halo's software.”
Doc Halo CEO Jose Barreau, MD, said, “At Doc Halo, our mission is to improve the quality of healthcare. We do this by providing physicians and healthcare organizations innovative mobile technologies that improve and secure their communication workflow. Partnering with American Messaging allows us to combine a very large customer base and critical messaging expertise with the healthcare domain expertise and superior technology of Doc Halo. We share a common mission and Doc Halo is very excited to partner with a company known throughout the country for its reliability and dependability.”
Pottle went on to say, “We could not be more pleased to partner with Doc Halo, which leverages both companies' core strengths. American Messaging has been a trusted provider of messaging services to the medical community for over 30 years, serving over 1,200 hospitals and medical practices throughout the United States, while Doc Halo's software and domain expertise ensure we can continue to evolve our collective product suite to ultimately improve patient care through more effective and efficient communication among healthcare professionals.”
Dave Andersen, President and Chief Operating Officer of American Messaging concluded by saying, “Our customers recognize the importance of utilizing the most reliable networks for their critical messages. They also realize the value of improving healthcare communications by providing secure messaging capabilities for physicians, staff members and call centers. This revolutionary and integrated healthcare communications platform will allow organizations to combine the reliability of paging technology for critical messaging with the improved efficiency and HIPAA compliance provided by secure messaging applications.”

NEW YORK, Sept. 18, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — July 15,  United Spinal Association  today announced a new partnership with Ivycorp, makers of a cloud-based multi-channel group communications platform called  Ivytalk  , to assist the organization with integration of short message service (SMS) technology in its future outreach efforts.
“Ivytalk will be invaluable in helping United Spinal ensure we are well-equipped to engage our members, donors and partners on a variety of digital platforms well into the future,” said Tom Scott, chief marketing officer at United Spinal.
Ivytalk features include business class messaging that allows staff to connect by email, SMS and IP that can be integrated with existing communications; and virtual phone lines that can connect directly to customers to deliver promotions.
“Our partnership with United Spinal Association illustrates the power of our mission - enabling conversations that were previously difficult or impossible and putting information in the hands of the right people at the right time for a positive impact—saving time, saving money and improving lives," said Mary Jesse, founder and CEO of Ivycorp.”
This year, United Spinal plans to integrate Ivytalk for its  #GivingTuesday campaign  —culminating on December 2nd—to attract new supporters to its mission of assisting people living with spinal cord injuries and disorders across the country.
#GivingTuesday is primarily a social media fundraising campaign revolving around the holiday season that brings together the nonprofit community to raise awareness on the work they do.
United Spinal is working directly with Ivycorp to enable its supporters to join exclusive groups via an online form that will share messages via email and mobile devices on how they can support United Spinal's #GivingTuesday campaign.
“Our goal is to utilize Ivytalk in our Giving Tuesday campaign outreach this year and to begin establishing a new donor base,” added Scott.

It played a significant role in writing the Americans with Disabilities Act, and made important contributions to the Fair Housing Amendments Act and the Air Carrier Access Act. Membership is free and is open to all individuals with SCI/D.

Motorola Moto 360
  $250.00 
Weak battery life, technical glitches and a bulky frame mar Motorola's first smartwatch.
Jared Newman@onejarednewman Sep 17, 2014 11:38 AM
Motorola was supposed to have this one in the bag.
When the first  Android Wear  watches showed up in early July, the near-unanimous opinion among reviewers was that you should wait before buying anything. A better-looking smartwatch called the Moto 360 would arrive by late summer, and with its round face and slick metal frame, it would make  Samsungâs Gear Live  and  LGâs G Watch  look like awkward nerdware.
But Motorola blew it. The Moto 360, available now for $250, could have been far and away the best Android Wear watch of the year, but itâs dragged down by terrible battery life, weak performance and hair-pulling glitches. If you want a truly great Android Wear watch, youâll need to keep waiting.
  Tastes vary, but Jon Phillips, our editor-in-chief, finds the all-black Moto 360 to be the more sophisticated design.  
Like other Android Wear watches, the Moto 360 pulls in notifications from an Android phone, and prompts further action. You can reply to text messages by voice, control your phoneâs music playback, get simple navigation directions, and more. The platform also supports some basic voice queries, such as asking what the weather will be, and pipes in information from  Google Now  . The system has its  flaws  , but itâs a helpful way to keep tabs on your digital life without constantly fishing into your pocket.
From afar, the Moto 360 could be the best-looking smartwatch on the market. Between its round design, metal trim, leather strap and crown-like button on the side, the Moto 360 approximates the look of an actual watch. And with the right wrist size and some business attire, you might be able to carry it off.
On my skinny wrist, however, the Moto 360 stands out a little too much. The watch body is about a tenth of an inch thicker than Samsungâs Gear Liveâthe slimmest of all currently available Android Wear watchesâand the way the skinny strap runs through the bottom of the watch body only emphasizes the bulky frame. Of course, personal tastes can differ, but the lack of a smaller, slimmer version makes the Moto 360 a non-starter for many potential users.
At least itâs comfortable, though. Motorola makes a big deal about how its leather straps (from  Horween  ) add a touch of class, but the real advantage is how good the watch band feels on the wrist. You get none of the stickiness and sweatiness that comes with Samsungâs plastic strap or LGâs rubber band. (Motorola is also selling a metal band for $80, but I havenât tried it.)
 JARED NEWMAN 
Even if youâre satisfied with the Moto 360âs look and feel, the watchâs battery life is a problem of deal-breaking proportions. The only way it lasts through a 16-hour day is if you disable the ambient screen setting, which completely turns off the display until you deliberately twist your wrist toward your eyes. Unfortunately, the Moto 360 has trouble detecting this gesture every time, so youâre often left tapping on the screen or crown instead. This defeats the purpose of even having the watch, as you can no longer just glance down at the display to see what youâve missed.
Turning on the ambient screen settingâwhich keeps the display dim but not completely offâcreates even bigger problems. The Moto 360âs ambient mode is much harder to read compared to the Samsung Gear Live and the LG G Watch, especially at off-axis viewing angles, and the hit to battery life is significant. In my testing, with ambient mode turned on, the watch never had more than 15 percent battery life left after 12 hours. And after long stretches of inactivity, sometimes the screen turned off anyway.
Itâs possible that the Moto 360âs  four-year-old Texas Instruments processor  is to blame for the weak battery life, but that ancient chip seems to cause general performance issues as well. While Android Wear runs fairly smoothly on the Qualcomm Snapdragon processors of other watches, the Moto 360 frequently suffers from stutters and dropped frames.
I also ran into one other maddening technical glitch: On several occasions, the Moto 360 would half-lose its connection to my smartphone (a second-generation Moto X, also on loan from Motorola). Iâd still get incoming notifications, but my attempts to interact with the watchâfor instance, by deleting an email or issuing a voice commandâwould bring up a âdisconnectedâ error. Only turning the phoneâs Bluetooth off and on fixed the problem.
This is all so frustrating because of how much the Moto 360 does right. If only the watch could make it through the end of the day, because the included wireless power dock is as effortless and elegant as it gets for nightly charging. Just place the watch on the stand, and the screen quickly converts into a dimly lit clock for your nightstand. In the morning, you just grab the watch by its strap and slap it back on your wrist.
 JARED NEWMAN   That black strip of missing pixels at the bottom continues to be annoying for various reviewers.  
Then thereâs outdoor legibility. While other Android Wear watches are all but impossible to read in direct sunlight, the Moto 360âs back-lit LCD display gets bright enough to shine through, and it uses an ambient light sensor to dial brightness down in darker settings. (On the downside, the sensor and display circuitry are the reasons for the Moto 360âs black bottom strip, which creates an imperfect circle on the display. That said, Iâm not as bothered by it as other reviewers.)
The Moto 360 also includes an optical heart rate monitor thatâs a lot more reliable and useful than the one on Samsungâs Gear Live. While Samsungâs heart rate results can be all over the map unless you stay perfectly still, the Moto 360 repeatedly spit back consistent results. More importantly, the Moto 360 keeps tabs on your heart rate at all times, and feeds the data into an activity monitor that encourages at least 30 minutes of activity per day. Itâs a far more practical use of the technology than Samsungâs highfalutin pulse checker.
So whatâs an Android enthusiast to do? If you want to see what Googleâs smartwatch platform is all about right now, I still recommend the Samsung Gear Live. While it isnât as stylish as the Moto 360, you can actually use for a full day, and you wonât run into technical snafus either. Itâs also $50 cheaper.
As for Motorola, my hope is that the company has the tenacity to try againâand quickly, even as it hangs in  Lenovoâs acquisition limbo  . Except for maybe the  LG G Watch R  , thereâs nothing on the immediate Android Wear roadmap that looks as promising as the Moto 360 did a few months ago.

FirstNet is set to issue a request for information (RFI) at its Sept. 17 board meeting, seeking input on issues such as whether FirstNet can be accessed by non-public safety users, which may be of interest to public utilities and other companies that may be compatible with the restrictions likely to be imposed on FirstNet participants. The RFI will also seek information on the potential for partnering with other carriers, especially rural telephone companies, to complete the buildout of the nationwide public safety broadband network as quickly and efficiently as possible. As reported by Fierce Wireless, Ed Parkinson, FirstNet's director of government affairs, announced the forthcoming RFI at last weekâs CCA convention.
The RFI will also ask a number of detailed questions focused on the core, radio access network (RAN), security and partnerships. The RFI is designed to lead to an RFP to move implementation of the network along.
"It's the vendor community that is going to dictate the best way this is going to be built," Parkinson said. He noted contracts for the network will be subject to a competitive process and will have to follow federal acquisition regulations.
We will update our clients once the RFI is issued.
[See following update.]
In a statement issued on Monday, Sprint Corp. confirmed that it had chosen not to bid in the upcoming FCC auction of AWS-3 licenses, known as Auction 97. "Sprint has decided not to participate in the FCC's AWS-3 auction but will continue to evaluate the opportunities presented by the upcoming 600 MHz incentive auction," said Sprint spokesman Jeffrey Silva in a statement.
Wireless industry analysts were generally not surprised by the companyâs announcement, since Sprint already has a significant amount of 2.5 GHz band spectrum from BRS/EBS licenses and lease rights it acquired with the closing of its Clearwire purchase in mid-2013. Moreover, compared to other nationwide carriers, Sprint has relatively little spectrum in sub-1 GHz bands, so the company appears to be conserving resources for participation in the 600 MHz incentive auction, which is currently targeted for mid-2015.
Short-form applications to participate in Auction 97 were due by the close of business last Friday (September 12th) so the timing of Sprintâs announcement suggests that the company may have been taking a proactive step to prevent the pending AWS-3 auction from getting in the way of ongoing business discussions with others who may have invested in an auction applicant or who be bidding themselves. However, it is not known whether Sprint has any indirect interests in other auction applicants, so clients that are participating in Auction 97 should still exercise due care in their dealings with Sprint (or any other major carrier for that matter).
With limited exceptions, the FCCâs anti-collusion rules prohibit auction applicants from communicating with each other during the auction (starting from the short-form filing deadline through the post-auction down payment deadline) about bids, bidding strategies, settlement agreements or matters concerning the post auction market structure, unless they have previously identified one another on their short-form applications as parties with whom they have entered into agreements. The rule against prohibited communications applies to all âcontrolling interestsâ in an applicant (e.g., officers, board members and key employees) and any individuals or entities that hold direct or indirect investments of 10% or more in a short-form applicant. While the anti-collusion rule provisions do not prohibit discussions regarding non-auction related business matters among auction applicants, the FCC has interpreted the restriction on prohibited communications as applying to any discussions about matters that âmay affectâ bids, bid strategies, etc., even if the auction is never directly discussed. Please contact us if you have any questions about dealings with other carriers during the pendency of the auction.
On Monday, the the Rural Business-Cooperative Service (an agency within the Rural Development mission area of the USDA) published a Notice in the Federal Register seeking comment on proposed changes to the regulations for the Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program in an effort to improve program delivery, clarify the regulations to make them easier to understand and reduce delinquencies.  Comments are due November 14. 
Specific revisions include:
By way of background, Rural Development provides financial supportâincluding direct loans, grants, and loan guaranteesâand technical assistance to help improve the quality of life and provide the foundation for economic development in rural areas. The B&I Guaranteed Loan Program was authorized by the Rural Development Act of 1972. The loans are made by private lenders to rural businesses for the purpose of creating new businesses, expanding existing businesses, and for other purposes that create employment opportunities in rural America. According to the Notice, the proposed changes could also result in increased lending activity, expanded business opportunities and creation of more jobs in rural areas.
On Monday, the FCC issued an Order on Reconsideration in its special access data collection proceeding in which it amended the collection requirements to reflect the conditional approval received from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) last month. In revising the requirements, the FCC effectively granted in part a petition for reconsideration filed by the Blooston Private Microwave Licensees.  Responses to the data collection are due by December 15, 2014. 
Specifically, the FCC has revised the special access data collection questionnaire and instructions at the direction of OMB by: (1) requiring the collection of 2013 data only, rather than 2011 and 2012; (2) revising the definition of âPurchasersâ to exclude entities spending less than $5 million on âDedicated Servicesâ in 2013 in price cap areas; (3) indicating those questions where responses are optional and not required or where information is required only if kept in the normal course of business by the respondent; and (4) adding footnotes to clarify which information is required.
By changing the definition of âPurchaser,â the FCC partially granted the Blooston petition for reconsideration, which sought an exemption from the collection for Part 101 point-to-point, non-common carrier microwave licensees that âare simply consumers of dedicated special access services.â According to the Order, by revising the definition of âPurchasersâ to exclude entities spending less than $5 million on Dedicated Services in 2013 in price cap areas, the FCC significantly reduced the estimated pool of respondents that are Purchasers, and therefore, likely significantly reduced the number of entities represented by Blooston that are required to respond to the collection.
Any entity subject to the Commissionâs jurisdiction that (a) provides special access service; (b) provides a connection that is capable of providing special access services; or (c) spent more than $5 million purchasing special access service in 2013 in price cap areas must respond to the data collection. A price cap area is an area served by a local exchange carrier that is subject to price cap regulation, such as AT&T or Verizon.  Clients seeking assistance with the data collection, including determining whether they are required to respond, should contact the firm without delay. 
On Monday, the FCC published the NPRM initiating a proceeding to review its Part 32 Uniform System of Accounts in the Federal Register, establishing comment and reply comment deadlines.  Comments are due November 14 and reply comments are due December 15. 
The major issues on which comment is being sought include consolidating Class A and Class B accounts; aligning the Uniform System of Accounts with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; requiring price cap carriers to comply with the Uniform System of Accounts; requiring price cap carriers to comply with targeted accounting requirements; state accounting requirements; effects of revisions on rates; timing of implementation of any changes; and legal authority.
A number of news sources are reporting that Federal Communications Commission investigators have joined an inquiry into the state of Idaho's handling of a school broadband contract.
According to the Associated Press article, an Aug. 26 letter from Idaho Department of Administration Director Teresa Luna indicates that âthe FCC Office of the Inspector General has subpoenaed the state for documents related to the Idaho Education Network, which has been the subject of a five-year lawsuit alleging the state illegally awarded the contract to provide broadband service to Idaho schools.â
Apparently, concerns arose when Syringa Networks (one of the vendors who bid for the state contract but did not receive a seat) challenged the Department of Administration's decision to award a $60 million contract to Qwest (now CenturyLink) and Education Networks of America. The Idaho Supreme Court in March 2013 cleared Syringa to pursue a lawsuit, prompting Universal Service to stop the federal payments (leaving the state program budget $8.5 million short).
Last week, U.S. Senators Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), and a bipartisan group of 14 other U.S. Senators sent a letter to Chairman Wheeler asking the FCC âto re-evaluate its telephone ârate floorâ policy in order to protect rural consumers from steep telephone bill hikes.â
According to the letter:
. . . as currently constructed, the rate floor puts rural telephone companies in an untenable position in which they must choose between raising rates to levels that, in some cases, are more than the rates their urban counterparts charge many of their customers, or receiving reduced universal service support. This is in spite of the fact that these rural exchanges often do not resemble their urban areas along key metrics like population, geography, and income, as well as other demographics.
Sens. Pryor and Boozman had previously called upon the FCC to delay the rate floor increase back when it was first announced that the floor was scheduled to increase from $14 to $20.46. In response, the FCC adopted an incremental phase-in of the new rate floor, with the first increase (from $14 to $16) due by December 1 of this year.
Last week the FCCâs Office of Managing Director announced the proposed USF contribution factor for Fourth Quarter 2014 as 16.1 percent, up from 15.7 percent in the previous quarter.
According to the Public Notice, contributions to the federal universal service support mechanisms are determined using a quarterly contribution factor calculated by the FCC, based on the ratio of total projected quarterly costs of the universal service support mechanisms to contributorsâ total projected collected end-user interstate and international telecommunications revenues, net of projected contributions.
If the FCC takes no action regarding the projections of demand and administrative expenses and the proposed contribution factor within 14 days following release of the Public Notice, they are deemed approved and the contribution factor will be used by USAC to calculate third quarter 2014 universal service contributions.
On September 12 the FCCâs Enforcement Bureau and Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis announced the names of panelists for two events in the Open Internet Roundtable series: âEffective Enforcement of Open Internet Requirementsâ and âTechnological Aspects of an Open Internet,â both of which will be held on September 19. The roundtables will be free and open to the public, and the FCC also will stream them live at  http://www.fcc.gov/live  .
The Effective Enforcement of Open Internet Requirements roundtable will consider ways to enforce effectively the proposed new Open Internet rules, exploring the utility of various current and proposed enforcement tools in the Open Internet context and discussing how to design fair and accessible FCC, dispute resolution processes for open Internet concerns. Panelists are  Rick Chessen  , Senior Vice President, Law & Regulatory Policy, NCTA;  Steve Coran  , FCC Counsel, WISPA;  Susan Crawford  , Visiting Professor, Harvard Law School & Co-Director, Berkman Center for Internet & Society;  Christine Hines  , Consumer and Civil Justice Counsel, Public Citizen;  Chris Riley  , Senior Policy Engineer, Mozilla; and  Michal Rosenn  , Deputy General Counsel, Kickstarter.
The Technological Aspects of an Open Internet roundtable will consider the technical aspects of ensuring an Open Internet, including questions of scope, transparency, blocking, mobile networks, and reasonable network management. Panelists are  Don Bowman  , Chief Technology Officer, Sandvine;  Al Jette  , Head of North American Industry Environment, Nokia Networks;  Jim Kurose  , Distinguished Professor of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Amherst;  Klara Nahrstedt  , Ralph and Catherine Fisher Professor, Department of Computer Science, University Of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;  Andrew Pile  , Chief Technology Officer, Vimeo;  Hans-Juergen Schmidtke  , Vice President, Product Management, Juniper Networks; and  Stephen Wolff  , Interim Vice President & Chief Technology Officer, Internet2.

We want to remind our clients that, as part of its revisions to the annual regulatory fee program, the FCC has expanded Cable Television regulatory fee to include Internet Protocol TV Operators. The regulatory fee for IPTV operators is $0.99 per subscriber as of December 31, 2014.
New this year, all regulatees that pay annually must make their regulatory fee payments electronically via the Commissionâs online Fee Filer payment system or by wire funds transfer directly to the US Treasury. As a result, regulatees will be required to access the FCCâs Fee Filer system (  www.fcc.gov/fees/feefiler.html  ) with their valid CORES FRN and password in order to initiate the process of filing their annual regulatory fees. For FY 2014, payment may be made electronically through the Fee Filer system as a credit card transaction or as an ACH Payment that utilizes your bank account information. Wire funds transfers to the US Treasury will be addressed below. The FCC no longer mails invoices for regulatory fees. These invoices are viewable in the FCCâs Fee Filer System.
Any client with questions should contact Richard Rubino at 202-828-5519.
To update yesterdayâs BloostonLaw Update, FirstNet voted to adopt a request for information (RFI) at its Sept. 17 board meeting as expected, seeking input on issues such as whether FirstNet can be accessed by non-public safety users,  and whether there is a potential for partnering with other carriers, especially rural telephone companies  , to complete the buildout of the nationwide public safety broadband network as quickly and efficiently as possible. FirstNet issued the RFI immediately, and the response deadline has been set as  October 17, 2014  . Therefore, RLECs and other companies interested in participating in this proceeding, with an eye toward establishing favorable rules for partnering with FirstNet in some fashion, will need to give this matter prompt attention. The text of the RFI is available at firstnet.gov.
