  Telecom operators were shouting fire ahead of the vote by the
European Parliament's Committee on Industry (ITRE) on the telecoms
package, on 24 February. The amendments that were announced on net
neutrality threaten to create two internet networks, the operators say.

  It is a position that managers from large operators, ranging from
Deutsche Telekom to Orange to Telefonica, defended in full force during
a meeting with Digital Agenda Commissioner Neelie Kroes, on 24 February
in Barcelona at the the Mobile World Congress. They had already sounded
the alarm in a letter addressed to EP rapporteur Pilar del Castillo
(EPP, Spain) and the shadow rapporteurs a week earlier.

  At issue are the definitions of 'specialised services'
and 'reasonable management' of traffic. The ITRE committee had
to decide between two amendments marking out 'specialised
services', such as television on demand (IPTV), teleconferences or
telemedicine, for example. The Socialists and Greens submitted a more
restrictive amendment than the one defended by the EPP and the Liberals.

  However, in both cases, MEPs only wanted specialised services to be
authorised if they did not affect the quality of internet access in
general. Incumbent operators view this as a constraint, which would
technically force them to create two separate networks and therefore a
two-tier internet. They also feel that these constraints will affect
competition between European operators and "innovative"
services, which require privileged internet access.
