Dear DG Trade,
Under the right of access to documents in the EU treaties, as developed in Regulation 1049/2001, I am requesting documents which contain the following information:
- a list of meetings of DG Trade officials and/or representatives
(including the Commissioner and the Cabinet) and representatives of individual companies, including lobby consultancies and law firms,
and/or industry associations, in which the upcoming trade
negotiations with the US were dealt with (between April 2013 and
today);
- minutes and other reports of these meetings;
- all correspondence (including emails) between DG Trade officials
and/or representatives (including the Commissioner and the Cabinet)
and representatives of individual companies (including lobby
consultancies and law firms) and/or industry associations, in which
the upcoming trade negotiations with the US were dealt with
(between April 2013 and today).
Please note that we are already aware of the documents related to
the Civil Society Dialogue and to the initial general public
consultations organised by DG Trade
(http://trade.ec.europa.eu/consultations/...), so that
these documents do not have to be included in the response to this request.
Yours faithfully,
Stefan Knoll
on behalf of Greenpeace CEE

Dear Mr Knoll,
With reference to your below request for access to documents, registered under the above mentioned reference number, we would like to inform you that your application is currently being handled. However, we were not in a position to complete the handling of your application within the time limit of 15 working days, which expires today.
An extended time limit is needed as your application concerns a large number of documents. We are currently identifying the documents and thereafter assessing them individually according to Regulation 1049/2015. 
Therefore, we have to extend the time limit with 15 working days in accordance with Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to documents. The new time limit expires on 12/11/2015.
We apologise for this delay and for any inconvenience this may cause. 
Yours sincerely,
DG TRADE

Dear Mr Knoll, 
With reference to your above mentioned request, where our deadline expires today, we would like to let you know that we are currently handling your request. Your application concerns a very large number of documents, which need to be assessed individually. Naturally we were not able to carry out this work within the normal time limits set out in Article 7 of Regulation 1049/2001.
The Regulation also provides for a possibility to confer with applicants in order to find a fair solution when an application concerns a very large number of documents. Article 6(3) provides that "in the event of an application relating to a very long document or to very large number of documents, the institution concerned may confer with the applicant informally, with a view to finding a fair solution". Based on this provision, we propose to handle your application in successive stages. The unit dealing with your request has proposed to have the list of meetings ready in early January. The related documents would then follow in batches. 
Please note that the unit in question that is dealing with the TTIP negotiations has a large number of ongoing requests from many applicants and they are handling all of them as timely as they can with the resources that are available to them. Therefore we would like to ask you for your patience and understanding in this matter.
Best regards,
DG TRADE

Dear Mr Knoll,
  
 Please accept our apologies for the delay in replying to your request. Due
 to the wide scope of your application it has taken significant time and
 resources to put together the long list of meetings – please see enclosed.
 This covers the first part of your request.
 Please note that the [1]Civil Society Dialogue Meetings and the [2]TTIP
 Advisory Group meetings are not listed as they are publically available.
  
 As for the meeting reports we would like to point out that we have had
 similar requests from other applicants covering different periods within
 your timeline. You may wish to refer to some of these replies which we
 understand have been made public on the 'asktheeu'-website.
  
 In particular, you can find documents for the following periods either
 attached or on line:
  
 10/04/2013 – 20/02/2014 – please find the documents in the zip file
 enclosed as they were released in the past (some of them can also be found
 [3]online);
 21/02/2014 – 11/12/2014 – documents can be found [4]online;
 12/12/2014 – 09/12/2015 – first two batches of documents can be found
 [5]online.
  
 By referring you to the on-line documents published by the 'asktheeu' we
 are simply seeking to speed up your access. In relation to the zip file we
 also attach as a courtesy copy the reply accompanying some of those
 documents which will enable you to understand the reasons for the
 redactions in the documents concerned. For reasons of privacy we have
 redacted the name of the applicant to whom we were replying at the time.
 In contrast to the other letters on the 'asktheeu', this letter is not in
 the public domain as far as we know.
  
 We will continue to work on your request in relation to the last period of
 your timeline (from 12 December 2014 to 29 September 2015) for which we
 are currently in the process of identifying and assessing meeting reports
 for possible release.
  
 Best regards,
