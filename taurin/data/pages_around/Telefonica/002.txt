 Net neutrality: Telefonica wants money from Google 
 
 network policy 
 
 
  The Spanish telecommunications group Telefonica has again expressed its interest in demanding additional fees from data-intensive internet services such as YouTube and consequently violating   net neutrality  .     Ren√© Schuster, Germany boss of Telefonica , stated in an interview with Manager Magazin that the economic models will change. Internet companies need additional capacities for data-intensive offers, but the investments in expanding the networks have so far been borne solely by the telecommunications companies. He sees revenue sharing options that Telefonica has already negotiated with some content providers. In addition, the telecommunications group could 'establish the payment relationship with the customer for Internet companies [...] - and thus earn money'.           Deutsche Telekom   also argues in a similar way, but Internet companies like Google are not prepared to respond to the advances. Google boss Eric Schmidt has so far spoken out heavily against revenue sharing and argued that telecommunications companies are dependent on content providers in order to be able to sell high-revenue data packages to users at all. The advances made by the telecommunications corporations also arouse harsh criticism from the network community, who regard a violation of network neutrality as a threat to freedom on the Internet. In Germany, the topic is gradually taking a higher place on the agenda, while in the USA there is already lively resistance to the plans of the network operators.
