Net Neutrality 8-29-2006

  Net Neutrality Links  
 I’m adding this link to the Net Neutrality Page. 
 The Future Network Will not be Neutral. 
 Let me start off with some facts: 
British Telecom makes sure that no other VoIP service can work on their network by blocking commonly used ports. Sify India, blocks all RTP packets to make sure that no other VoIP service is used on their network 
 The US charges developing countries per bandwidth, which is a major deterrent for growing economies to adopt faster connectivity. There are a lot of ISPs in the US, who make sure that Vonage doesnt work on their network. 
 Etisalat blocks off most sites, and no voice related service, including MSN, Yahoo, or Skype could work on their network 
 This is today. And this is not a Net Neutral reality. What makes you think that the future is going to be any different?

 Someone once said, “I have a dream” someone else said, “You may say I’m a dreamer” I say that the world is powered by the dreams dreamers dream. 
 “This is today. And this is not a Net Neutral reality. What makes you think that the future is going to be any different?” 
 Well a lot of people are dreaming of a future that’s different from today (and don’t  even  get me started on all the ways it could be improved) and those dreams can power great changes.  That’s what makes me think the future is going to be different.

 That’s so cool. I saw your name and thought “Good morning, Katie!” 
 Thanks I just got a cup. It’s so nice around here in your computer and your coffee is way better than Starbucks. 
 I’m a dreamer too, but then I bet you already knew that. It’s kind of hard to keep quiet too long. It shows up in that optimistic outlook we dreamers teend to have.  
 I love the song by Supertramp called “Dreamer.” I know and value every word of it. *She puts on her headphones and puts on the song she’s talking about.* 
 The line in the chorus I like a lot is  
Dreamer . . . 
Can you put your hands in your head?  
 I like to ask myself that, because it “keeps me honest.” 
 I can dream about net neutrality, but the minute I think reality, people spoil the picture with their petty issues and conflicts of insterest. So dreaming only makes me sadder.

 “people spoil the picture with their petty issues and conflicts of insterest. So dreaming only makes me sadder.” 
 I’m not quite that emotional about the net neutrality thing.  But I feel  exactly  like that about “health care for everyone.”  But, then I remember that dreams are more powerful than negativity.  And that even as the Wright Brothers were flying their plane for the first time (and even after) some people said that flight is impossible.  I thank God everyday that the Wright Brothers didn’t listen to them.   
 And I don’t think we dreamers should listen to the naysayers now.

 I’m smiling, Katie, because I agree with you about not listening to naysayers.  
 I think of them as rain on parades . . . interesting to watch, but not fun to hang around in. 🙂 
 I’m not emotional . . . maybe I should have said   dsappointed   rather than   sadder.

 (whew) I couldn’t stand going through the day thinking about you being saddened by the naysayers.   I like the disappointed substitution too.  And actually I feel sorry for them.  Think of all the cheap entertainment they miss by not being able to turn on a daydream whenever they get bored!

 Awareness will do the trick. Force tactic don’t work for long. If one ISP service is providing a facility ‘A’ and the other is not and you want the facility ‘A’, then why stay with the service that does not provide it? The one thing businesses get scared of is losing paying customers. They should be scared often to keep them in line :-).

 Liz — Me too!  Well, including the cell phones…. 
 And we get our cable modem from a different company than we get the cable TV.  For one thing, I’m not sure I want any one company to know every digital thing about me.  And I’m less likely to lose both my Internet and my TV at the same time (which would render me helpless)

 Once you get past a certain level of personal fortune, money becomes meaningless and it becomes all about power and control. 
 This coupled with the sociopathic traits and pathologies needed to rise to the top of a Fortune 500 makes me nervous…

 Exactly – and the ‘net is now threathening their nice little game of Monopoly on Communications. I’m not sure I trust the lawmakers to get it Right, but I’m sure I trust the telcos and cable to get it Wrong if we don’t tell them “no, you can’t do that.”
