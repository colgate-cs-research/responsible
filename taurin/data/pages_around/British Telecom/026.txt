It is very important for firms to be clear about their business strategies so as to attain increased growth and long term sustainability for the future (Arora and et.al., 2017). The present study has thus focused on making a study about the business strategy of BT (British Telecom) which belongs to telecommunication sector of UK. The study will analyze the external as well as internal environment and the capabilities possessed by the organization. Porter’s five forces model will also be applied which will then be followed by suggesting proper strategies by which the overall competitive position of the company can be improved. Task 1 the external environment 1.1 PESTLE model for environmental analysis In order to assess the overall nature of external environment that is being faced by British Telecom the need is to focus on Pestle analysis which is as follows;  Political factors – British Telecom group operates in a diverse political environment. In UK, the European Union has set the framework for fiber access, spectrum and net neutrality and thus widening the scope of operations of BT. The policy of Digital Agenda in UK helps the BT group to promote high speed networks. It is considered that latest political factor, Brexit, in UK would be beneficial for British Telecom to some extent. It is so as higher interest rates due to brexit will reduce its pension liability. However, a recent policy reform introduced by UK telecoms Ofcom announced a three times increase in license fees to be paid by companies in telecom industry in UK (Akio, 2005). This may have a negative impact on overall costing of BT. British Telecom has to work under strict policies introduced by the UK government with respect to network access facilities.  Economic factors – Economically, globalization is on a rise and with this, more and more businesses are likely to enter the telecom industry. This demands to introduce more effective communication and services from British Telecom. A change in investment climate facilitated by growing demand will lead to emergence of new businesses in the UK telecom industry. In addition, there will be further opportunities for Mergers & Acquisitions, with increasing scope of services in the UK telecom industry. In 2015, BT 3 had acquired EE from Deutsche Telecom and Orange. This synergy as helped British Telecom in improving cost efficiencies through economies of scale (Cardeal and Antonio, 2012). However, economic factors such as tax and interest rates and recession in UK will also have an affect on business of British Telecom. With this, BT can use factors like inflation and growth rates as well as industry indicators such as consumer spending and growth rate to track its growth in future.  Social factors- Socially, there are a number of positive changes that have an influence on telecom industry of UK and British Telecom as well. Earning capabilities have increased leading to increase in investment rates. The ratio of younger to older generation is higher which results in increased use of internet and various communication technologies. Growth in use of smart phones and smart devices as well as faster network in future will lead to an increase in British Telecom operations (Gassmann, 2006).  Technological factors – In lieu of the current technological advancements British Telecom is required to keep in pace with technology by working on issues like faster networks, poor signal and coverage. Investments in high speed network and alliances for 5G network will be the latest technological developments in the telecom industry. BT has announced to invest £6bn on supe fast broadband and extend high speed service coverage all across UK by 2020. Capitalizing on ‘Cloud of clouds’ services by Global Services division of British Telecom will help in achieving high economies of scale. ‘Cloud of clouds’ strategy helps the companies in bringing all independent and distinct cloud services under one umbrella (Grant, 2010). Though BT has always catered to the latest technology but still the company will have to keep track of recent technological developments by its competitors. Investment in and latest technology would also have an impact on cost structure and value chain of BT.  Legal factors – British Telecom has been often affected by various legal aspects. One of such aspect is ruling by Ofcom, wherein the UK telecom regulator makes way for separation of open reach from BT. Another regulation is prohibiting use of mobile phones while driving which has an impact on usage of network thus affecting the overall service and revenue of British Telecom (Kraaijenbrink, Spender and Groen, 2009). In addition, scope of services of BT also gets affected by laws related to consumer data protection 4   You’re reading a preview To View Complete Document Click the button to download  Subscribe to our plans Download This Document
