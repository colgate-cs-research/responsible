 European telecom firms vow to spur development of a 5G network but only if the government weakens net neutrality. 
 
 (CCM) —  A coalition of 20 European telecommunications firms unveiled plans for the deployment of a 5G network across Europe in a new manifesto dubbed the  5G Manifesto . The seven-page document, introduced last week, was signed by major telecom players including Deutsche Telekom, Orange, British Telecom, and Nokia and details the conditions required by the coalition to begin work. Among the conditions outlined in the  5G Manifesto  is the end of net neutrality — a subject that has been a long-standing point of opposition between telecom operators and the European Commission. "The telecom industry warns that the current net neutrality guidelines, as put forward by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, create significant uncertainties around 5G return on investment," the document states. "Investments are therefore likely to be delayed unless regulators take a positive stance on innovation and stick to it." In short, if net neutrality clauses are not reviewed, the companies will not agree to the 5G investment.
 
 The conditions of the  5G Manifesto  have put sudden pressure on the European Commission, which is fully dedicated to the rapid development of 5G across the continent. The 5G movement promises to help avoid creating a technological gap that could be fatal to many future innovations, such as the worldwide  Internet of Things  movement. Last month, the United States Federal Communications Commission announced plans to roll out  5G networks  across the nation later this year.
