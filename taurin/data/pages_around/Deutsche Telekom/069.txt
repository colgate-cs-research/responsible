  Deutsche Telekom is expanding its StreamOn zero-rating offering today with a third option for games.   StreamOn Gaming   enables mobile gaming without using up the data volume of the mobile phone contract. The new option is free of charge in Telekom's Young tariffs, and costs € 2.95 per month with normal tariffs.     Regardless of the criticism of the   zero rating  , that certain Deutsche Telekom is today expanding StreamOn to include a gaming option that does not take into account data consumption for games for smartphones and tablets.     17 games to start StreamOn Gaming     At the start,   Deutsche Telekom   brought 17 partners on board, includingTitles like Asphalt 8 and 9, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale, Fortnite and Pokémon Go.       Asphalt 8     Asphalt 9     Big Farm: Mobile Harvest     Clash of Clans     Clash Royale     Disney Magic Kingdoms     Dungeon Hunter Champions     Elvenar - Fantasy Empire     Empire Four Kingdoms     Forge of Empires     Fortnite     Hatch Cloud Gaming     Need for Speed: No Limits     Pokémon Go     Real Racing 3     World of Tanks Blitz     World of Warships Blitz       StreamOn Gaming is a free option in the MagentaMobil XS to L Young tariffs . Only in the standard tariffs MagentaMobil S to L and with the Family Card S to L is a monthly basic price of 2.95 euros. This makes it clear that theTelekom wants to address primarily young people under the age of 27 with StreamOn Gaming.       No zero rating abroad     The same general conditions apply to StreamOn Gaming as to StreamOn for music and video. This means that, for example, advertising and other content that is not part of the actual game is still deducted from the data volume. The service can only be used domestically; data usage abroad is calculated normally when playing games. StreamOn Gaming can also no longer be used if your own data volume has already been used. In principle, the option does not include a minimum contract term and can be canceled daily.     More data volume for MagentaMobil XS and M Young   In addition, Deutsche Telekom today announced more included LTE data volume for new and existing customers of MagentaMobil XS and M Young increases to 8 GB. The prices remain unchanged, as well as double the data volume of 4 and 16 GB.           continues to apply to users of MagentaEINS
