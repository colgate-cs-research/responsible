 Mere days after the  European Parliament voted in broken net neutrality laws that allow for traffic shaping and internet fast lanes , the first EU telecoms company has announced plans to introduce a two-tier internet, allowing priority access to paying customers. In a statement on the company’s website ( in German ), CEO Timotheus Höttges said Deutsche Telekom will introduce charges for startups to access specialised internet services. 
 “There needs to be the option of giving priority to data associated with sensitive services if the network is congested,” says Höttges ( translation courtesy of Euroactiv ). “Developing innovative internet services with high standards of quality will continue to be possible.” 
 “Start-ups need special services more than anyone in order to have a chance of keeping up with large internet providers,” Höttges argues. “If they want to bring services to market which require guaranteed good transmission quality, it is precisely these companies that need special services. By our reckoning, they would pay a couple of percent for this in the form of revenue-sharing,” 
 In response to Deutsche Telekom’s plans,  Vodafone Germany told German newspaper Der Spiegel , “Vodafone is not currently pursuing such plans [for internet fast lanes], but in our view, Deutsche Telekom’s position is correct,” adding that, “an equal internet does not even exist today.”
