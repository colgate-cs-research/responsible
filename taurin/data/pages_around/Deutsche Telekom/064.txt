##TITLE: Avaaz - EU: Keep the Internet Free and Open
##METHOD: article 1


The richest 1% is using every trick in the book  to control what we all see and do online. Last week a gang of multinationals including Deutsche Telekom, Nokia and Vodafone, launched a desperate effort  to weaken the free and open Internet we all rely on. If they succeed, our ability to connect with each other to fight corruption, save lives, and protect the environment will be severely compromised. But  if an unprecedented number of us act in the next few days, we can meet this new attack  and help secure strong Internet protections in Europe and the world. 

With a  public comment period running right now, we just need to flood them with hundreds of thousands of voices  calling on EU regulators to close all loopholes that threaten to ruin the promise of a democratic, free Internet. Sign now to join and tell everyone --  we have just 6 days left.
