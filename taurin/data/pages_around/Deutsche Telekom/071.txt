 There is no need for any specialized technical knowledge to download videos from Twitch. The procedure begins with a twitch page link. Copy the link from the address bar of your browser and paste it into the white box above. And then press the GO button. Our system will find and display the download link  https://gramvio.com/download-twitch-videos/  for all possible formats and bitrates.

 I would like to see much more on Twitch, but the data volume in Germany is simply too expensive. Unfortunately, I often do not have the opportunity to access a Wi-Fi.

 some additional information: 
 German mobile provider Deutsche Telekom includes a service called StreamOn with its mobile contracts. 
 If you have a contract that includes StreamOn you can stream from over 100 streaming services, like Spotify, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon prime video and many more without using your data allowance.
 I can stream all of those services on the go without having to restrict myself in any way. 
 I'd love to be able to watch Twitch on the go as well without having to worry about using my precious 12GB! 
 When asked whether Twitch would become a partner anytime soon, Deutsche Telekom replied that Twitch would just need to apply and then surely be approved to join the service.  
 Here's the link to apply for a StreamOn partnership. 
 https://www.telekom.de/hilfe/mobilfunk-mobiles-internet/mobiles-internet-e-mail/streamon/streamon-partner-werden?samChecked=true 
 I truly hope you'll join soon, seeing that Amazon prime video is already included :)
 Hopefully you have someone who speaks German, if not I can ask Deutsche Telekom to provide an English application for you. 
 Kindest regards, 
 Martin

 Why haven't they done anything? I sent a mail to Twitch Support with the link where they can apply and even offered my help if they don't have anyone who speaks German! 
 Please Twitch, come on!
