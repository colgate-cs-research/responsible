 So since we are going to definitely lose Net Neutrality since nothing people say matters and the rulers are blindly evil - do you think we could push this into a fight for municipal broadband with direct democratic control? Can’t be fucked by Comcast if we create our own fiber-optic internet that is controlled by the people.

 This might be relevant:  http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html TLDR, we can totally DIY an internet. Don’t even need no fancy-schmancy fiber optic, which makes it more accessible (and thus less susceptible to capture by the state), to the point where you wouldn’t even need to do it through municipal government–you could do it yourselves, with some friends, in your neighborhood.

 I’ve been thinking about this post all day and I think there are a few things it’s important to understand. 1. “The Internet” is a term that gets thrown around a lot seemingly without a solid understanding of what it really means. The internet, at its most basic, is a  network of networks . There are basically two types of organizations that participate directly: service providers (Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T are some of the best-known to the general public) and end-users (companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon). These organizations build their networks internally, connecting all of the devices they manage (sometimes this means running fiber under the ocean), and then at the edge of their network they connect to someone else’s network (usually several someone elses). ISPs will allow organizations to connect through them to another organization.  This is sort of the core idea of the internet - you don’t have to connect directly to the person you’re trying to reach, as long as there exists a path to them somewhere.  Which brings me to point number 2. 2. You can make your own DIY network, sure.  But you’d have to connect it back to the rest of the world’s networks  somewhere (preferably in a few places) or it wouldn’t be very useful apart from for sharing files with your neighbors. There are some companies specially geared toward that… 3. Some ISPs are mostly in the business of connecting other ISPs and large end-users - but not residential customers. Examples include Level3, Cogent, Hurricane Electric, TATA, Zayo, Lightower, XO, etc. They all connect to each other in datacenters or datacenter-like places.  They also often run cables (usually fiber these days) to businesses that will pay for it , but those services are much more expensive than residential services at the same nominal speed. Why? Well, there are lots of reasons, mostly things like support (imagine calling your ISP’s tech support and actually getting someone who understands networking and cares about your problem) and SLAs (service level agreements - - guarantees that you get the service you’re paying for or your money back). But one of the big reasons is oversubscription. 3.5. Everyone knows when you buy a residential internet package advertised at 100M/20M (100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload) that you’re not actually getting that. Why not? Because of oversubscription. Your connection to your neighborhood node might have that much bandwidth, but so do all 8 of your neighbors, and that node  also  has that much bandwidth back to your ISP’s local datacenter. Which means that you and your neighbors are sharing that node-to-datacenter bandwidth. I read somewhere that residential connections often have an oversubscription ration of 9:1. Now most of the time that’s fine, which is why ISPs get away with it. Most customers don’t all use their bandwidth at the exact same time - they use it in short bursts (downloading a single file) and then they stop. So, it’s not really a big deal, but it’s important to know about. 4.  Building your own network is not as easy as it looks. Yeah, it’s easy to make a wireless point-to-point link between your house and your neighbor’s house, but it’s  not  that easy to do it across larger distances. The biggest difficulty is you need line-of-sight, which means you either need to get on high buildings (which costs money unless the building owners are bros) or build towers (which  definitely  costs money). The free-to-use wireless frequencies are susceptible to rain interference, so you should also have a backup link in a different frequency, which means you have to get FCC approval and pay a yearly fee. And you want to have redundant paths (multiple ways of getting from the customer to the internet uplink) in your network so that if something happens to one node (it gets struck by lightning or something), you don’t have an outage. 5. There are other ways to build networks (as mentioned in the link above) but they are slower and less reliable. They work well for people in areas where that’s their only option, but I think (and I could be wrong about this) that it would be difficult to get the average American to switch from their mostly-reliable Verizon connection, complete with repair workers you can call when there’s a problem, to a P2P mesh network that usually gets 10Mbps but sometimes slows down to 500Kbps for 6 hours at a time because an important repeater node gets broken by a basketball down the street. I read  a post  today about how Maine built a huge, municipal fiber ring that anyone can license. They are currently trying to approve building more fiber that will reach people’s houses directly. This will be the ideal, because it lowers the entry costs to being an ISP significantly and allows pretty much anyone to offer service, greatly increasing competition. Part of the problem is that no matter  who  you connect to, whether it’s Comcast or Hurricane Electric, without Net Neutrality they can block your connections to other organizations. Even if you connect to an ISP and they don’t block or slow any connections,  someone else in the path  between you and whatever site you’re trying to reach might block or slow those connections. The only way to  guarantee  that you can connect (without artificial speed limitations) to an organization is to  connect directly to that organization . That sort of defeats the “core idea of the internet” I mentioned above - that you  don’t  have to connect directly to everyone you want to communicate with. So, in conclusion: yes you can build your own network, but it is hard and will only help if you only connect to/through providers that obey Net Neutrality anyway.

 Remember the last time the FCC nearly killed net neutrality? Tumblr had this nice big banner at the top of your dashboard alerting any active user about the problem. Guess what has changed since then? Verizon, one of the companies gunning for the death of net neutrality owns yahoo who in turn own Tumblr. Spread the word, tell everyone you can: battleforthenet.com tag posts you see about net neutrality with popular tags so the news spreads.

 My new favorite thing to do is tell guys who have no profile photo how hot they are. Usually they’re just confused by my compliment but sometimes they get paranoid that they accidentally uploaded a profile picture.
