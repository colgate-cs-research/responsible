1 Internet Traffic and Content Consolidation Craig Labovitz Chief Scientist, Arbor Networks S. Iekel-Johnson, D. McPherson Arbor Networks, Inc. J. Oberheide, F. Jahanian University of Michigan
2 Talk Outline Describe two-year traffic measurement study The original Internet topology The emerging new Internet Application transport and the end of end-to-end A few words on IETF implications Page 2 - IETF
3 Two Year Study of Inter-domain Traffic Graphic not an accurate representation of current ATLAS deployments Leverage large, widely deployed commercial Internet monitoring infrastructure Global deployment across 110+ ISPs / Content Providers Near real-time traffic and routing statistics (14 Tbps) Participation voluntary and all data sources are anonymous Largest study of its kind Page 3 - IETF
4 Study Details Within a given ISP, commercial probe infrastructure Monitors NetFlow / Jflow / etc and routing across possible hundreds of routers Probes topology aware of ISP, backbone and customer boundaries Routers typically include most of peering / transit edge Some deployments include portspan / inline appliances Deployments send anonymous XML file to central servers Includes self-categorization of primary geographic region and type Data includes coarse grain anonymized traffic engineering statistics ATLAS Centrally maintained servers ISP / Content Providers Introduced at NANOG 47 academic paper under review, Arbor blog provides ongoing related bits Page 4 - IETF
5 Traffic Measurements Inter-domain traffic volumes Estimate directly monitoring 25% all inter-domain traffic Believe data representative of global inter-domain traffic Validate predictions based on data (using 12 known ISP traffic demands) Measurement Confidence Does NOT measure Number of web hits, tweets, transactions, customers, etc. Internal / private customer traffic (e.g. VPNs, IPTV) ISP success nor profitability Page 5 - IETF
6 Original Internet ( ) Settlement Free Pay for BW Pay for access BW Textbook diagram (still taught today) Hierarchical, relatively sparsely inter-connected Internet Mostly accurate until recently (modulo a few name changes over the years) Page 6 - IETF
7 Market Forces Reshape Traffic and Connectivity Revenue from Internet Transit Source: Dr. Peering, Bill Norton Revenue from Internet Advertisement Source: Interactive Advertising Bureau Page 7 - IETF
8 Largest Carriers: Then and Now Rank 2007 Top Ten % 1 ISP A ISP B ISP C ISP D ISP E ISP F ISP G ISP H ISP I ISP J 1.23 Rank 2009 Top Ten % 1 ISP A ISP B Google Comcast Based on analysis of anonymous ASN (origin/transit) data (as a weighted average % of all Internet Traffic). Top ten has NO direct relationship to study participation. In 2007, top ten match tier-1 ISPs (e.g., Wikipedia) In 2009, global transit carry significant traffic volumes But Google and Comcast join the list And a significant percentage of ISP A traffic is Google transit Page 8 - IETF
9 The New Internet Settlement Free Pay for BW Pay for access BW Flatter and much more densely interconnected Internet Significant routing, traffic, security, economic, implications Disintermediation between content and eyeball networks New commercial models between content, consumer and transit Page 9 - IETF
10 Consolidation of Content (Grouped Origin ASN) In 2007, thousands of ASNs contributed 50% of content In 2009, 150 ASNs contribute 50% of all Internet traffic Approximates a power law distribution Page 10 - IETF

Over time, Google increasingly using direct peering with tier2/3 and eyeball networks As of February 2010, more than 60% of Google traffic does not use transit Remainder largely global transit carriers These numbers do not include GGC Page 12 - IETF

14 What s Happening? Commoditization of IP and Hosting / CDN Drop price of wholesale transit Drop price of video / CDN Economics and scale drive enterprise to cloud Consolidation Bigger get bigger (economies of scale) e.g., Google, Yahoo, MSFT acquisitions Success of bundling / Higher Value Services Triple and quad play, etc. New economic models Paid content (ESPN 360), paid peering, etc. Difficult to quantify due to NDA / commercial privacy Disintermediation Direct interconnection of content and consumer Driven by both cost and increasingly performance Page 14 - IETF

21 IETF Implications Increasingly dense Internet and impact on routing scalability and convergence Slow IPv6 deployment highlights need for alternative transition mechanisms The end of end-to-end Increasing impact of firewall, NAT Silo ed ecosystems Page 21 - IETF
22 Conclusion Internet is at an inflection point Focus shifting from transmission to content Battle for access to eyeballs (and control of content) Transit is commoditized and devalued New focus on datacenters and co-location (caches) New technologies reshaping definition of Internet Web / Desktop Applications, Cloud computing, CDN Changes mean significant new commercial, security and engineering challenges This is just the beginning Page 22 - IETF
